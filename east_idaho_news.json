      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #breakingnews \n\nPHOENIX \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell is back in Idaho where she will spend the rest of her life behind bars in Pocatello.\n\nPHOENIX \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell is back in Idaho where she will spend the rest of her life behind bars in Pocatello.\n\nDaybell has been incarcerated at the Estrella Jail in Maricopa County, Arizona, since November 2023. She left the facility early Monday morning and was flown to Idaho, according to a Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesperson. She was then booked into the Idaho Department of Correction Pocatello Women\u2019s Correctional Center.\n\nVideo released from the sheriff\u2019s office shows multiple armed deputies escorting Daybell from her cell as she wears handcuffs and leg shackles. She is walked outside and before being placed in a law enforcement SUV, she smiles and looks up at the sky. A deputy puts on her seatbelt and Daybell is then driven away with multiple police SUVs in front and behind her. It\u2019s unclear what time Daybell arrived in Idaho.\n\nThe move comes after Daybell was found guilty of two counts of conspiracy to commit the murders of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and former nephew-in-law, Brandon Boudreaux.\n\nDaybell had already been convicted in Idaho for murdering her two children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan, along with conspiring to commit the murder of Tammy Daybell, her husband\u2019s first wife. Following those convictions in 2023, the state of Arizona extradited her to Maricopa County with the understanding that she would return to Idaho to complete her life sentences.\n\nDuring an interview with EastIdahoNews.com in June, Daybell complained about the conditions at the Estrella Jail and said she looked forward to returning to the Pocatello prison.\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Support East Idaho News: https://www.eastidahonews.com/donate/\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on X: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "title": "ENTIRE INTERVIEW: Lori Vallow Daybell speaks with Nate Eaton from behind bars",
      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #interview \n\nPHOENIX \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell is still in love with her husband, believes the two will be exonerated and says she did not know her children were buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s property.\n\nThe convicted killer spoke with EastIdahoNews.com on her 52nd birthday during a 40-minute interview Thursday at the Estrella Jail in Maricopa County, Arizona. She railed against the legal system, argued the media has misrepresented her with a false narrative and maintained her situation is a family tragedy, not a string of serious crimes.\n\n\u201CEveryone in the world knows I didn\u2019t hurt anyone. I\u2019ve never hurt anyone in my entire life,\u201D Daybell said. \u201CThe only evidence that ever came out is the evidence the state wanted to put forth. They manipulate the evidence to make it look however they want and guess who helps them? The media helps them.\u201D\n\nDaybell\u2019s children, Tylee Ryan and Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, were found in June 2020 buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s Fremont County property. She was sentenced to life in prison in Idaho in 2023 for the murders, along with conspiracy to commit the murder of Chad\u2019s former wife, Tammy Daybell. A separate jury found Chad guilty of the same crimes, and he was sentenced to death in 2024.\n\nLori Daybell was also found guilty in Arizona this year of conspiracy to commit the murders of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and her former nephew-in-law, Brandon Boudreaux. She will be sentenced for those crimes next month.\n\n\u201CIn this unfair judicial system, anybody could be found guilty of anything,\u201D Daybell told EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CBe careful who you\u2019re judging because anybody could end up in orange. You could be living your little life in the suburb bubble like I was and anybody could end up in orange because they could turn this on anybody.\u201D\n\nDaybell failed to give specific answers to questions about why she didn\u2019t talk with the police when her children could not be found and hinted that Tylee may have accidentally killed JJ before taking her own life. Her version of events doesn\u2019t match evidence presented in the Idaho trials that showed Tylee died weeks before JJ and was dismembered before being burned. JJ was found wrapped in tight plastic and duct tape.\n\nDaybell said facts surrounding her children\u2019s remains \u201Care wrapped up around a whole lot of untruth,\u201D and the evidence is part of a \u201Cfake narrative.\u201D\n\nWhen asked why Daybell didn\u2019t tell anyone where her kids were until their remains were discovered, she responded, \u201CIt was very traumatic and I was not ready for any of that.\u201D She claimed she did not know JJ and Tylee were buried on Chad\u2019s property as her brother Alex Cox, who died in December 2019, \u201Ctold me that he put them in a safe place.\u201D\n\nDaybell claimed she had not seen JJ and Tylee\u2019s autopsy photos until her Idaho trial and said she had no control over her cases as a defendant, which is one of the reasons she decided to act as her own attorney in Arizona.\n\nBefore standing trial in Idaho, Daybell was deemed incompetent and committed to State Hospital North, where doctors diagnosed her with a delusional disorder marked by hyper-religiosity. After ten months, it was determined she was fit to stand trial. She was also found competent for trial in Arizona.\n\nDuring her interview with EastIdahoNews.com, she repeatedly referred to her faith and said that in 2017, the Lord told her she would become like Job and lose everything. She said Jesus is her friend, speaks with her often and Daybell spends hours every day in her jail cell writing about her experiences that will one day be \u201Creal good scripture reading.\u201D\n\nRead the entire story here: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2025/06/lori-vallow-daybell-says-in-jailhouse-interview-that-she-never-hurt-anyone-and-will-be-freed/\n\n\u25BA Support East Idaho News: https://www.eastidahonews.com/donate/\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on X: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/\n\n--",

      "title": "Prosecutor responds to Lori Vallow Daybell\u0026#39;s request for a new trial",
      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #trial \n\nPHOENIX -- A Maricopa County prosecutor says Lori Vallow Daybell\u0027s request for a new trial should be denied because \u0022there was no juror misconduct, no prosecutorial misconduct, no improper exclusion of hearsay testimony and no lack of impartiality by the court.\u0022\n\nMaricopa County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Treena Kay filed a 16-page response Tuesday to Daybell\u0027s motion for a new trial.\n\nA jury found Daybell guilty of conspiracy to commit the murder of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, on April 22. She represented herself and it took the jury less than three hours to reach a guilty verdict.\n\nIn her filing last week, Daybell asked Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Justin Beresky to grant her another trial for a number of reasons, including a statement made by a juror on live television after the verdict was announced. \n\n\u0022You know, I feel sorry for her, driving home yesterday, I was like, God, she\u0027s spending the next three lives in prison, in a cell,\u0022 the juror said.\n\nThe Idaho crimes were not discussed in the Arizona trial. Jurors were not supposed to know Daybell was convicted in 2023 of murdering her two children, Joshua JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan, along with conspiracy to commit the murder of Tammy Daybell, her husband\u0027s first wife.\n\nKay responded to Daybell\u0027s argument by pointing out the juror was \u0022mobbed\u0022 by the media after walking out of the courthouse and made multiple statements while answering questions.\n\n\u0022In the initial media contact, one of the media asked Juror Fifteen and another juror, \u0027Were any of you folks aware that this woman had already been convicted of three homicides?\u0027 Juror Fifteen responds, \u0027No, no. I did not,\u0027\u0022 Kay wrote.\n\nKay also pointed out an interview the juror did with Hidden True Crime in which he \u0022repeatedly stated that after the verdict was read and they were released from the admonition, he started \u0027Googling\u0027 Lori Vallow while still in the Jury Room.\u0022\n\nDaybell also raised concerns that statements made by Tylee and her brother, Alex Cox, after Charles Vallow was shot were not allowed into the trial. The statements were considered hearsay because Tylee and Cox are dead and could not be called as witnesses.\n\n\u0022There is no exception that permits their admission,\u0022 Kay wrote. \u0022The defendant never established a foundation that any statements made by Alex Cox or Tylee Ryan hours after the shooting were admissible under any of the Arizona Rules of Evidence. The testimony of Alex Cox and Tylee Ryan were appropriately precluded as hearsay.\u0022\n\nIn response to allegations that Kay committed a discovery violation by not turning over a hard drive with Vallow\u0027s cell phone information to the defense until the middle of the trial, the prosecutor said the information was disclosed to Daybell\u0027s team in January 2024 - over a year before the trial started.\n\nKay noted that Beresky told Daybell before the trial started that she could request a delay if she needed more time to have her expert review the data.\n\n\u0022The defendant advised she wanted to proceed with trial instead of seeking a continuance to allow her expert time to review the victim\u0027s cell phone,\u0022 Kay wrote.\n\nIn her motion, Daybell accused Kay of committing prosecutorial misconduct by giving false statements during her closing argument. Kay responded that Daybell \u0022intentionally mischaracterized\u0022 one sentence from the entire argument.\n\n\u0022The State made argument to the jury regarding the defendant\u0027s demeanor (the day of the shooting)...Witnesses described the defendant...as chatty, nonchalant and unaffected by her brother allegedly being struck with a baseball bat, her husband lying dead in her house and her children no longer having a father,\u0022 Kay wrote. \u0022The defendant\u0027s demeanor with law enforcement the day of the murder was in complete opposition to the defendant\u0027s demeanor during opening statements where the defendant attempted to testify as to facts that were never brought in by the defendant during the trial and crying in front of the jury.\u0022\n\nAnother reason Daybell said she deserves a new trial is that Beresky struck two of her proposed witnesses, EastIdahoNews.com reporter Nate Eaton and Brandon Boudreaux, from her list before the trial started. Boudreaux is Daybell\u0027s former nephew-in-law. \n\nRead the rest of the story on EastIdahoNews.com.\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Support East Idaho News: https://www.eastidahonews.com/donate/\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on X: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "title": "Lori Vallow Daybell files motion for a new trial based on these five reasons",
      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #trial \n\nPHOENIX \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell says there were multiple problems with her Maricopa County, Arizona trial last month and she wants it redone.\n\nA jury found Daybell guilty of conspiracy to commit the murder of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, on April 22 following a seven-day trial. Daybell represented herself and it took the jury less than three hours to reach a guilty verdict.\n\nIn a 13-page motion filed Thursday, Daybell asked Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Justin Beresky to grant her a new trial for five reasons:\n\nJuror misconduct\nPreclusion of statements from Tylee Ryan and Alex Cox and the impermissible expert testimony by Chandler Police Det. Daniel Coons\nDiscovery violation\nProsecutorial misconduct\nCourt\u2019s lack of impartiality\nDaybell cites a television interview with a juror conducted immediately after the trial in which he seemed to acknowledge being aware of her prior convictions. Daybell was found guilty in Idaho of murdering Tylee Ryan and JJ Vallow, her two children, and conspiracy to commit the murder of Tammy Daybell.\n\n\u201CYou know, I feel sorry for her, driving home yesterday, I was like, God, she\u2019s spending the next three lives in prison, in a cell,\u201D the juror said.\n\nThe Idaho crimes were not discussed in the Arizona trial and jurors were not supposed to know about Daybell\u2019s murder convictions.\n\nIn her motion, Daybell also raises concerns that statements made by Tylee and brother, Alex Cox, after the shooting of her husband were not allowed into the trial. The statements were considered hearsay because Tylee and Cox are dead and could not be called as witnesses.\n\n\u201CDuring trial, this defendant was precluded from even discussing that Alex conducted a walk-through (of the home after the shooting), much less his statements with Chandler Police Detectives during that walk-through,\u201D Daybell wrote.\n\nDaybell\u2019s motion goes on to accuse Maricopa County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Treena Kay of committing a discovery violation by not turning over a hard drive with Vallow\u2019s cell phone information to the defense until the middle of the trial.\n\nDaybell says Kay committed prosecutorial misconduct by giving false statements in court and eliciting \u201Cirrelevant, prejudicial, and improper character evidence\u201D from a witness.\n\nBeresky\u2019s \u201Clack of impartiality\u201D is another reason Daybell believes she deserves a new trial. She says the judge struck two of her proposed witnesses, EastIdahoNews.com reporter Nate Eaton and Brandon Boudreaux, from her list before the trial started. Boudreaux is Daybell\u2019s former nephew-in-law.\n\n\u201CBefore testimony began, the court required this defendant to establish on the record what relevancy her witnesses would present. This required this defendant to state in front of the prosecutor her defense strategy. This is not required under the law or any rule of evidence,\u201D Daybell wrote.\n\nDaybell also raised issues with a statement Beresky made while she was cross-examing a witness and trying to \u201Cestablish that being translated was a regular part of the Mormon religion and thus a relevant line of questioning.\u201D\n\nKay objected to the questioning, but Beresky overruled the objection and said, \u201CI guess to the extent that you are comparing yourself to these biblical figures I will allow it.\u201D\n\nKay is expected to issue a response to Daybell\u2019s motion before Beresky grants or denies the motion.\n\nDaybell has another trial scheduled to begin June 2 on a conspiracy to commit murder charge for Boudreaux. She has pleaded not guilty.\n\n\u25BA Support East Idaho News: https://www.eastidahonews.com/donate/\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on X: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #dateline \n\nIDAHO FALLS \u2014 Keith Morrison has spoken with dozens of inmates over his career but says nothing comes close to his jailhouse interview with Lori Vallow Daybell.\n\n\u201CI don\u2019t think I\u2019d try to compare it with anything. She is a very interesting person to talk to,\u201D Morrison tells EastIdahoNews.com.\n\nThe veteran Dateline correspondent admits he was surprised when Daybell agreed to speak with him. Morrison and his producer, Shane Bishop, had worked for years trying to secure an interview. After several letters and emails, Daybell said yes.\n\nDateline associate producer Brittany Morris worked with the Maricopa County Jail and the Dateline team was given 90 minutes to interview the woman at the center of one of the biggest criminal cases in Idaho history.\n\n\u201CI thought that would be plenty of time to get what we needed from anybody, but it turns out, it wasn\u2019t enough time to get what we needed from Lori Vallow,\u201D Morrison explains. \u201CI could have gone on with her a lot longer.\u201D\n\nDaybell winked at the camera when she walked into the room, according to Morrison, and the interview became combative. A preview video posted on Dateline\u2019s Facebook page Wednesday shows Daybell repeatedly challenging the journalist by saying, \u201CGet your facts straight, Keith,\u201D \u201CI thought we were going to be friends, Keith,\u201D and \u201CAren\u2019t appearances not what they might seem to be, Keith?\u201D\n\n\u201CShe\u2019s no dummy. I think she decided ahead of time that she was going to tell this shaggy dog tale that would take up the time and I wouldn\u2019t be able to ask all my questions and she could lay out this, frankly, big lie about what happened to Tylee and JJ,\u201D Morrison says.\n\nDaybell is awaiting trial in Arizona for the death of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow. Her current husband, Chad Daybell, is on death row in Idaho.\n\nShe was sentenced to life in prison in Idaho in 2023 for the murders of her two youngest children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan, along with Chad Daybell\u2019s former wife, Tammy Daybell. A separate jury found Chad Daybell guilty of the same crimes, and he was sentenced last year.\n\n\u201CShe bounced all over the map in discussion of those topics but she had her own agenda,\u201D says Morrison. \u201CThe chore was to get her off that train track and get her on to what we wanted to talk about\u2026She wants everybody to know what the truth is, but the truth is in her head.\u201D\n\nMorrison says Daybell was charming, humorous, upbeat, friendly and intelligent. She does not see herself as mentally ill, even though she was declared incompetent for trial two times in Idaho and spent ten months in a Department of Correction mental health facility.\n\n\u201CI could see how she could be the ringleader in a group of people who are addicted to some kind of \u2018out-there\u2019 idea. If they could be sucked into an idea of that sort, Lori could certainly be the person who could charm them into following her down the yellow brick road,\u201D Morrison explains.\n\nWhen the interview was over, Morrison was mentally exhausted. Daybell told him he would have to come back so he could ask any remaining questions.\n\n\u201CI came out of there thinking, \u2018I never want to do that again.\u2019 But curiously, even though I was terribly frustrated at the end, I would go back and do it again. It\u2019s weird,\u201D he says.\n\nThe two-hour \u201CDateline\u201D special also features interviews with Rexburg Police Detective Ray Hermosillo, Madison County Sheriff Ron Ball, Madison County Prosecutor Rob Wood, retired FBI agent Douglas Hart, EastIdahoNews.com reporter Nate Eaton and Colby Ryan, Lori Daybell\u2019s oldest son.\n\n\u201CIt was a heartfelt conversation about what he has gone through and how he\u2019s trying to rebuild his life,\u201D Morrison says. \u201CI must say I felt for Colby so much more after having spoken to his mother than I could have before.\u201D\n\nThis is the seventh episode \u201CDateline\u201D has produced on the Daybell case. It airs Friday on NBC at 8 p.m. MST and is available for streaming on Peacock the following day.\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Support East Idaho News: https://www.eastidahonews.com/donate/\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on X: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #vallow #daybell \n\nPHOENIX \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell will be allowed to represent herself in two Arizona criminal trials, a judge ruled Friday morning.\n\nJudge Justin Beresky asked Daybell multiple questions during a 15-minute hearing about whether she understands the legal system (yes), her level of education (high school graduate), whether she understands English (yes), and why she wants to act as her own attorney.\n\n\u201CFor the past five years that I have been incarcerated, I have taken it upon myself to study case law and criminal rules of procedure in the state of Idaho and Arizona as well as federally,\u201D Daybell said. \u201CFor the past ten years, prior to my incarceration, I did study procedure in family law and I have real trial experience. I have participated in three different full trials from beginning to end. One in family court, two in criminal court.\u201D\n\nDaybell faces two charges of conspiracy to commit murder in connection to her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and her former nephew-in-law, Brandon Boudreaux.\n\nDuring a hearing Thursday, Daybell was ruled competent to stand trial in both cases. Trials will be held separately, Beresky said Friday, and two advisory attorneys \u2013 Pamela Hicks and Robert Abernethy \u2013 will be appointed to assist Daybell in her defense.\n\nShe told the judge she is \u201Cvery prepared\u201D for the trials, even after Beresky told Daybell the cases could be complicated with lots of potential evidence.\n\n\u201CI am well aware of that,\u201D Daybell responded.\n\nDaybell will prepare motions, give an opening statement, question witnesses and could take the stand. Beresky said if she decides to testify, she will need to write out prepared questions and have her advisory attorneys ask them to her.\n\nIf Daybell does not behave in court, fails to show up or changes her mind about representing herself, the advisory attorneys would take over as lead counsel. If that happens, anything that has happened up to that point in the trials cannot be repeated.\n\nBeresky scheduled the trial in the Charles Vallow case to begin on March 31. The Boudreaux trial will be scheduled after the Vallow trial is complete.\n\nDaybell\u2019s next court appearance is scheduled for Jan. 10.\n\nDaybell was sentenced to life in prison in Idaho last year for the murders of her two youngest children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan, along with her fifth husband\u2019s former wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\n\u25BA Support East Idaho News: https://www.eastidahonews.com/donate/\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on X: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #Vallow\n\nPHOENIX -- Lori Vallow Daybell will need to undergo mental health evaluations before court proceedings in her Arizona case can resume.\n\nJudge Justin Beresky made the decision during a hearing Wednesday morning, denying a request from Daybell\u0027s attorneys to withdraw a motion her former defense team filed requesting a Rule 11 evaluation. Rule 11 governs competency evaluations for defendants who may be mentally incompetent to stand trial. \n\n\u0022She has sufficient mental capacity to understand the nature of this dispute and there has been no history of irrational behavior,\u0022 said Pamela Hicks, one of Daybell\u0027s attorneys. \n\nDaybell was extradited from Idaho to Arizona a year ago on two charges of conspiracy to commit murder in connection to her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and her former nephew-in-law, Brandon Boudreaux. \n\nHer former attorneys withdrew from the case last month, citing a conflict of interest, and new defense counsel was appointed. They immediately filed a motion to withdraw the Rule 11 evaluation that Beresky had issued weeks earlier.\n\nDaybell\u0027s competency was an issue before her murder trial in Idaho. She was admitted to an Idaho Department of Correction mental health facility after being found incompetent for trial in June 2021. Ten months later, she was deemed competent. Court proceedings were again paused for about a month in 2022 due to competency issues, but Judge Steven Boyce ultimately deemed Daybell fit for trial.\n\nEarlier this month, Daybell made it known she wanted to represent herself going forward in the Arizona case. Beresky asked her Wednesday if she had ever been found incompetent in the past.\n\n\u0022Not to my understanding. My understanding was the judge did the same thing you did in an abundance of caution and I came out competent,\u0022 Daybell responded.\n\nDaybell explained she went through \u0022a process of several things\u0022 while in the Idaho facility - including competency classes, meeting with doctors and \u0022many, many evaluators.\u0022\n\nHicks said her client has already spoken briefly with one mental health evaluator in Arizona and Maricopa County Prosecutors asked Beresky to order Daybell to speak with another expert, to which her defense team objected.\n\n\u0022We\u0027re going down a rabbit hole,\u0022 said defense attorney Robert Abernathy as Daybell nodded her head. \u0022If she doesn\u2019t want to talk to the doctors, she doesn\u2019t have to talk to the doctors.\u0022\n\nDespite arguments against the Rule 11 evaluation, Beresky said it will remain in place and another expert will evaluate Daybell. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for Dec. 5.",

      "title": "Lori Vallow Daybell says nobody was murdered \u0026 she is fulfilling mission in new interview with son",
      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #investigation \n\nIDAHO FALLS -- Lori Vallow Daybell says her children were not murdered, she is on a mission from Jesus and her case has been blown \u0022way out of proportion.\u0022\n\nThe convicted killer made the statements to her oldest son, Colby Ryan, in a phone conversation from the Maricopa County Jail in Arizona. She is awaiting trial on conspiracy to commit murder charges in relation to Charles Vallow, her fourth husband, and Brandon Boudreaux, her former nephew-in-law.\n\nRyan posted the 64-minute conversation Sunday on his YouTube program, \u0022The Scar Wars podcast.\u0022It\u0027s the first time he has spoken with his mom in four years, and the first time the public has heard from Daybell since she read a statement at her sentencing in Fremont County in July 2023. Judge Steven Boyce ordered her to serve life in prison for the murders of Tylee Ryan and Joshua \u0022JJ\u0022 Vallow, her children, and Tammy Daybell, the former wife of her current husband, Chad Daybell.\n\nAt times, the call between Ryan and Daybell is interrupted and hard to hear due to background noise at the jail. But for the majority of the conversation, Daybell maintains she is \u0022following Jesus\u0022 and \u0022doing her job.\u0022\n\n\u0022There is higher knowledge for people who need to know it. People who don\u2019t need to know it, don\u2019t need to know it. It comes directly from Jesus to me. It doesn\u2019t come from any other source. It comes from Jesus Christ directly to me,\u0022 Daybell says.\n\nDaybell stood by statements she made during her sentencing that nobody was murdered; rather, accidents, suicides and \u0022fatal side effects of medications happened.\u0022 \n\nShe blamed Tylee for the deaths, saying shortly after the family moved to Rexburg, her daughter was mad at her. Daybell insinuated that while Tylee was babysitting JJ at their apartment, she accidentally killed him and then took her own life.\n\n\u0022What if Tylee was holding JJ down and trying to get him not to scream and be loud in an apartment? What if she held him down too long and realized afterward what she had done?\u0022 Daybell said to Ryan. \u0022When I came in on that scene and they were gone, I thought Tylee did it to get back at me. I thought it was all my fault. I thought she was mad at me, and that\u2019s what happened.\u0022\n\nDaybell told Ryan that once she found her dead children, she \u0022ran out,\u0022 and someone else did something with their bodies.\n\n\u0022I wasn\u0027t aware what happened to them after I left that scene,\u0022 she said. \u0022Their spirits were gone from their bodies. They were already in heaven.\u0022\n\nDaybell\u0027s explanation does not match the timeline investigators laid out during her trial - that Tylee died first, on Sept. 9, 2019, two weeks before JJ was killed on Sept. 23, 2019. Their bodies were found buried on Chad Daybell\u0027s property in June 2020.\n\nJJ was found wrapped in plastic and duct tape with a plastic bag taped over his head. Tylee\u0027s body had been cut up and burned before she was buried. Parts of her are still missing.\n\n\u0022She was brutally mistreated after her death. It wasn\u0027t even human. It\u0027s the most brutal thing I\u0027ve ever heard in my life,\u0022 Ryan told his mom.\n\nShe responded, \u0022When I found my little precious babies, there was no bag. There was no duct tape. There was nothing like that. They were just gone. Anything that was done was after the fact - long after the fact.\u0022\n\nAfter the children died, Daybell said JJ and Tylee visited her, presumably in spirit form, and Tylee \u0022told me, \u0027I\u2019m sorry, Mom, for being such a brat.\u0027\u0022 \n\n\u0022The reason Tylee and JJ visited me right after that is to tell me it wasn\u2019t my fault. I was blaming myself 100%,\u0022 Daybell said. \u0022I didn\u0027t want anyone to know what Tylee had done to JJ. I wanted to continue to protect Tylee as her mother who has been trying to protect her for her whole life.\u0022\n\nRyan told his mom he does not believe her claims, and she is \u0022beyond deceived.\u0022 Daybell responded that her case has been blown out of proportion and the \u0022media flood\u0022 against her is from Lucifer.\n\nRead the rest of the story here:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/2024/10/lori-vallow-daybell-says-nobody-was-murdered-and-she-is-fulfilling-divine-mission-in-new-interview-with-her-son/\n\n\u25BA Support East Idaho News: https://www.eastidahonews.com/donate/\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on X: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #property \n\nSALEM \u2014 The property where Chad Daybell and his family lived in Fremont County is now owned by a nonprofit organization.\n\nSJ Healing Crossroads took ownership of the 3.75 acre lot at 202 North 1900 East on Friday. John Prior, Daybell\u2019s attorney, became owner of the property in 2021 after his client was arrested on murder charges.\n\nThe four bedroom, 1,900 square home was put on the market in June with an asking price of $350,000. Tammy Daybell, Daybell\u2019s first wife, was killed inside the home in October 2019. Daybell then married Lori Vallow and her two children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan, were found buried behind the house in June 2020.\n\nDaybell was found guilty of their murders and is on death row. Vallow Daybell was also found guilty and sentenced to life in prison without parole.\n\nA local couple, who followed the case closely and wants to remain anonymous, created SJ Healing Crossroads with the intention of purchasing the property and supporting those affected by traumatic loss.\n\n\u201CSuch a horrible tragedy happened there and we wanted to be sure the right thing was done with the property,\u201D the couple tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CThis is all about respecting JJ, Tylee and Tammy and the victims.\u201D\n\nThe couple says they plan to first tear down the home and outbuildings on the lot. From there, nothing is set in stone as they want to consult with family members affected by the tragedy. They\u2019ve already spoken with several people close to the case over the past few weeks.\n\n\u201CWe want to transform this site from one of sorrow and tragedy into a place of peace, healing and hope for the community,\u201D they say. \u201CThis won\u2019t be a playground with swings and a slide but a respectful place.\u201D\n\nDaybell\u2019s family members no longer live in the home and \u2018No Trespassing\u2019 signs have been put up. The nonprofit is now raising funds to help pay for demolition efforts and volunteers who want to help lend a hand moving forward are asked to reach out.\n\nDonations to SJ Healing Crossroads are being accepted via GoFundMe, PayPal and at any Bank of Commerce location. You can also send a check to:\n\nPO Box 1346\nIdaho Falls, ID 83403\n\nMore information can be found on the SJ Healing Crossroads website here.\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Support East Idaho News: https://www.eastidahonews.com/donate/\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on X: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #chaddaybell \n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 A judge has found there are \u201Cextraordinary circumstances\u201D in Chad Daybell\u2019s case and granted his appellate attorney\u2019s request for more time in filing for post-conviction relief.\n\nDuring a hearing Wednesday morning, Judge Steven Boyce heard argument from Ian Thomson, one of Daybell\u2019s three Idaho appellate public defenders. The judge denied a request to allow video or still photographers in the courtroom and the hearing was not livestreamed on his YouTube channel.\n\nDaybell said nothing during the hearing as he appeared via Zoom from the Idaho Maximum Security Institution in Boise wearing a dark green jumpsuit.\n\nThomas listed multiple reasons why more time is needed to effectively file for post-conviction relief, which is a process wherein a defendant asks the court to vacate or modify a judgment of conviction, or to reduce or modify a sentence.\n\n\u201CWe are clearly committed to Mr. Daybell and giving him the very best representation we can,\u201D Thomson said. \u201CWe also know the restraints under which we operate and we are going to do our best to meet both.\u201D\n\nIn death penalty cases in Idaho, a motion for post-conviction relief must be filed within 42 days of someone receiving their sentence. Hearings and a ruling from a judge must then be complete within 90 days, meaning post-conviction relief in Daybell\u2019s case had to be wrapped up by Oct. 15.\n\nThomson noted the enormous amount of evidence his team needs to go through, including 16,800 pages of trial transcripts and 12,700 gigabytes (18,000 CDs) of other information. His office is also handling seven other death penalty cases and the attorneys have been working with Daybell less than three months.\n\n\u201CWe came across some information just a few days from the trial that dramatically changes our framing of the issue in regard to mitigation. As we go further into the case, we expect different insights to emerge,\u201D Thomson said. \u201CMore than any other case in the last 26 years, this case presents the facts that there are extraordinary circumstances. Mr. Daybell has a statutory right to counsel in post conviction and that comes with a constitutional right of effective assistance of counsel. Without additional time, we are not going to be able to represent Mr. Daybell effectively.\u201D\n\nFremont County Prosecuting Attorney Lindsey Blake acknowledged the massive amount of discovery, witness testimony, evidence and information from Daybell\u2019s case. She did not oppose the motion for additional time but said it should not be longer than necessary.\n\n\u201CWhile it appears the 90 days would need to be extended, I don\u2019t think the extension would be indefinite,\u201D Blake said. \u201CIt was a lengthy trial with multiple pre-trial proceedings leading up to the trial. We recognize counsel needs an opportunity to review the items from this matter.\u201D\n\nThe Idaho Supreme Court must approve Boyce\u2019s ruling for the post-conviction relief proceedings to be continued. Assuming that happens, Boyce said he will then set up a scheduling conference to keep the case moving forward.\n\n\u201CThis case does have a showing of extraordinary circumstances that would make it impossible for this post-conviction petition to be fully completed by Oct. 15,\u201D Boyce said.\n\nA jury sentenced Daybell to death in June following an eight week trial in Ada County. He was found guilty of murdering his first wife, Tammy Daybell, and two children \u2013 Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan \u2013 belonging to his current wife, Lori Vallow Daybell.

      "title": "A closer look at why it takes so long to execute someone in Idaho",
      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #execution \n\nBOISE \u2014 A 12-person jury sentenced Chad Daybell to death this month, but it will be many years, maybe decades, before the Fremont County man is executed.\n\nNine inmates are on death row in Idaho, with Daybell being the latest addition. Thomas Creech, the longest-serving inmate on death row, was sentenced to die 41 years ago, and an attempt was made to execute him in February but was called off after medical workers could not establish an IV line.\n\nThe seven other inmates have been on death row since 1986, 1992, 1993, 1996, 2004 and 2017, with the current length of stay averaging at just over 27 years.\n\nRELATED | Who is on death row in Idaho?\n\nThe main reason for the long delay in executing inmates is due to a lengthy set of appeals, according to L. LaMont Anderson, the chief of the Idaho Attorney General\u2019s Office Capital Litigation Unit. He has been an attorney in the division for 27 years.\n\n\u201CMy unit is responsible for doing all the appellate work in capital cases in Idaho,\u201D Anderson tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CThe appellate work from the capital arena includes appeals to the Idaho Supreme Court, the United States Supreme Court, the U.S. District Court for the state of Idaho and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201D\n\nAutomatic appeal and post conviction relief\n\nThe Idaho Supreme Court automatically reviews each death penalty sentence separate from any appeal that may be filed. This is not optional, cannot be waived and during this time, the death sentence is suspended.\n\n\u201CCapital cases are very, very different from noncapital cases,\u201D Anderson says. \u201CInstead of going directly to an appeal, you have post-conviction relief, and that petition has to be filed within 42 days of the entry of the judgment. In noncapital cases, you have the guilt phase, you have the sentencing phase, you have the first appeal and then after that first appeal, you go to post-conviction. But everything is consolidated in a capital case.\u201D\n\nAccording to Idaho law, \u201Cthe defendant must file any legal or factual challenge to the sentence or conviction that is known or reasonably should be known\u201D including any claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nThe defendant is appointed appellate public defense attorneys who review everything that took place during the trial, guilt and sentencing phases.\n\n\u201CAlthough the initial petition has to be filed within 42 days after the judgment has been entered, capital defendants are permitted to amend the petition,\u201D Anderson says. \u201CThe state public defender\u2019s office will have to review the transcripts, the clerk\u2019s records and all of the exhibits. In a trial of that nature, it will take several months for the court reporters to transcribe the entirety.\u201D\n\nRead the rest of the story here: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2024/06/a-closer-look-at-why-it-takes-so-long-to-execute-someone-in-idaho/\n\n\u25BA Follow Nate Eaton on Facebook:   https://www.facebook.com/NateEatonReporter/\n\u25BA Follow Nate Eaton on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/n.eaton/\n\u25BA Follow Nate Eaton on X: https://twitter.com/NateNewsNow\n \n\u25BA Support East Idaho News: https://www.eastidahonews.com/donate/\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on X: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #news #chaddaybell \n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 Judge Steven Boyce has issued an order permanently sealing nearly 100 exhibits displayed in Chad Daybell\u2019s murder trial.\n\nThe decision comes after Boyce says he received several requests for the evidence from authors and members of the media. Daybell was sentenced to death earlier this month after a jury found him guilty of murdering Tammy Daybell, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan.\n\n\u201CCertain requests seek to obtain all of the exhibits in this case, with some expressly requesting the autopsy photos published to the jury in this case,\u201D Boyce wrote in his order. \u201CThe Court notes that at trial those photos were published to the jurors, the parties, the Court, and in some instances privately to the victims, upon their request. They were not however publicly disseminated.\u201D\n\nBoyce says in making his decision, he is balancing the rights of the victims and the public\u2019s right to case information \u201Cincluding those who have a vested interest in monetizing the tragedy surrounding this case.\u201D\n\n\u201CThe Court was particularly moved by several victim impact statements at sentencing expressly criticizing individuals proclaiming to be \u2018media\u2019 who, in the course of this case, have disrupted the lives of the families of these victims in the past and now continue their efforts to sensationalize and capitalize on this case,\u201D Boyce wrote. \u201CSome of those family members described in detail the psychological trauma they have unfairly been subjected to by the \u2018media,\u2019 simply because they had some familial relationship to the victims in this case.\u201D\n\nIn referring to \u201Cmedia,\u201D Boyce noted he does not mean established and historically recognized reporting agencies but \u201Ctrue crime\u201D bloggers and YouTubers.\n\nBoyce sealed 97 exhibits, including photos taken during the autopsies of Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, Tylee Ryan and Tammy Daybell. Pictures of the human remains found on Daybell\u2019s property are also permanently sealed.\n\n\u201CThe interests of the victims and their family members to be spared the ongoing trauma of such sensitive or gruesome material being disseminated is not outweighed by the right of public disclosure of this evidence,\u201D Boyce wrote. \u201CVictims Tylee Ryan, JJ Vallow, Tamara Douglas Daybell and their family members\u2019 respect, dignity and privacy are best protected by the continued sealing of these exhibits.\u201D\n\n\u25BA Support East Idaho News: https://www.eastidahonews.com/donate/\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on X: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#chaddaybell #daybell #eastidahonews \n\nREXBURG -- It started with a phone call from police in Arizona about a Jeep possibly tied to a homicide.\n\nRexburg Police Lt. Ray Hermosillo was assigned to check it out and had no idea how much that call would change his life over the next four years.\n\nFrom two missing children, dead spouses, insurance fraud, extreme religious beliefs and a complicated series of events spanning multiple states, Hermosillo became the lead Rexburg detective in the Daybell case. He sat in the courtroom every day during Lori Vallow Daybell\u0027s trial in the spring of 2023 and testified three times during Chad Daybell\u0027s trial this year.\n\nHermosillo worked closely with Madison County Prosecuting Attorney Rob Wood who initiated legal proceedings against the couple and helped convene a grand jury which led to multiple murder charges being filed against Chad and Lori Daybell. Both were convicted on all counts by two separate juries. Chad Daybell is facing the death penalty and Lori Vallow Daybell is serving three life sentences without the possibly of parole.\n\nFor the first time, Hermosillo and Wood sat down with EastIdahoNews.com for their first in-depth interview about the case. They shared details about the investigation that have never been reported before along with what they\u0027ve learned, the challenges of the case, how it\u0027s changed them and how multiple  law enforcement agencies came together in the pursuit of justice for Joshua \u0022JJ\u0022 Vallow, Tylee Ryan and Tammy Daybell.\n\nWatch the entire conversation in the video player above.\n\n\u25BA Follow Nate Eaton on Facebook:   https://www.facebook.com/NateEatonReporter/\n\u25BA Follow Nate Eaton on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/n.eaton/\n\u25BA Follow Nate Eaton on X: https://twitter.com/NateNewsNow\n \n\u25BA Support East Idaho News: https://www.eastidahonews.com/donate/\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on X: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #sanctions \n\nBOISE -- A judge has issued an order imposing sanctions on a Mountain Home attorney who filed an error-filled motion asking to intervene in the murder case of Chad Daybell.\n\nTerry Ratliff filed the motion on Friday, March 29 at 11:42 p.m., just two days before jury selection was set to begin in the trial. Several words were misspelled \u2013 including \u0022motion,\u0022 \u0022continue,\u0022 and \u0022proceedings\u0022 and Ratliff had the case number wrong. He claimed three times in the motion that he represented Daybell as his defense attorney, which was not true, and requested Judge Steven Boyce continue the trial.\n\nBoyce sealed the motion and held a hearing on the matter at the Ada County Courthouse on April 18. He told Ratliff he was angry the lawyer was wasting time and resources in the middle of a capital murder case.\n\nRatliff explained he used a template when he filmed the motion and blamed the many mistakes on the fact he was nervous.\n\n\u0022This is a template form and I simply forgot to take it off,\u201D Ratliff said. \u201CIn the body of the motion, I say I am filing it without permission of the defendant or his counsel.\u201D\n\nBoyce asked who he was representing. Ratliff responded he should have signed the motion as \u0022citizen.\u0022\n\n\u201CYou\u2019ve got your name, your Idaho state bar number, your Ratliff Law Office and attorney for defendant. You\u2019re telling me you mistakingly filed something as a citizen and not an attorney?\u201D Boyce asked. \u201CWhy were you doing that on a Friday night at almost midnight?\u201D\n\nRatliff responded that he needed to do something to slow the case down to which Boyce replied, \u201CThis trial is scheduled for how many years and you wanted to slow it down the day before it started?\u201D\n\nThe judge ruled Ratliff violated the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure and sanctioned the attorney. He was ordered to reimburse the defense, prosecution and court for their time spent working on the issue.\n\nIn a written order filed Monday, Boyce said John Prior, Daybell\u0027s attorney, spent three hours addressing the \u0022frivolous pleading.\u0022 Prior\u0027s hourly rate is $350/hour and Ratliff was ordered to pay him $1,050.00. \n\nProsecutors collectively spent 2.75 hours addressing the pleading, according to the order, and requested fees at the rate of $65/hour, for a total of $178.75. \n\n\u0022The court has considered whether its own time spent on the pleading should be added as well, and has determined that the sanction of time from both parties suffices as a reasonable and adequate sanction under Rule 11. Therefore, the court sanctions Mr. Ratliff the sum of $1,228.75,\u0022 Boyce wrote.\n\nRatliff must make the payments within 30 days or could be held in contempt of court.",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #celebration \n\nIDAHO FALLS \u2014 Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan were remembered for their big hearts and loving personalities during a Celebration of Life Saturday afternoon.\n\nOver 200 people gathered in the Colonial Theater and thousands watched from around the world as family members and friends honored the two children, whose remains were found buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s property in June 2020.\n\n\u201CThis started a number of years ago when I stood in front of a camera and said, \u2018Where are the kids? Where are the kids? Where are the kids?\u0027\u201D said Larry Woodcock, JJ Vallow\u2019s grandfather. \u201CNow we\u2019re here. I want to thank God for the spirit he has given me and for all of you.\u201D\n\nLarry and his wife, Kay Woodcock, have waited for years to hold a memorial for JJ and Tylee in eastern Idaho. They wiped tears from their eyes as a video of The Rexburg Children\u2019s Choir singing \u2018Give Me Jesus\u2019 with Fernando Ortega was played at the beginning of the service.\n\nBrian Wood, owner of Wood Funeral Home, conducted the Celebration of Life and the lobby of the Colonial Theater was filled with photos of JJ and Tylee. When it was his turn to speak, Larry Woodcock did not stand at the podium; rather, he sat next to a large picture of JJ on the stage and shared memories of his grandson.\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s my little man,\u201D he said, pointing to the photograph. \u201CWe are blessed to forever be known as paw-paw and maw-maw\u2026I wish you could have met JJ and knew him and loved him as we loved him.\u201D\n\nTodd Trahan, JJ\u2019s biological father, is currently incarcerated in Louisiana but called into the service unannounced and recalled seeing his son for the last time in 2019. JJ was drinking chocolate milk and Kool-Aid while eating popcorn.\n\n\u201CNo parent in this world can prepare themselves for the things that happened to you. I\u2019ve asked God why he would let things happen like this,\u201D Trahan said. \u201CYou have been a warrior since you were born \u2013 two pounds, eight ounces. The spirit of God was with you and is with you more now watching over me.\u201D\n\nWoodcock and Pastor Larry Cudmore read a three page letter from cousin Zac Cox, who recalled watching television shows with Tylee and going to Jack in the Box late at night with her. He said Tylee was JJ\u2019s protector and \u201Cwe\u2019re all thankful for that.\u201D\n\n\u201CI still can\u2019t wrap my head around anything that has happened and why this happened to you and JJ,\u201D Cox wrote. \u201CNot a day goes by that I don\u2019t think about what you would be doing if you were still alive and still here.\u201D\n\nOther memories of the children from friends were also read at the service along with a poem titled \u201CThe Smile\u201D by Brandon Boudreaux, JJ and Tylee\u2019s former uncle. Another family member, Megan Conner, performed \u201COver the Rainbow,\u201D \u201CTears in Heaven,\u201D \u201CGo Rest High on that Mountain\u201D and \u201CAve Maria.\u201D\n\nCudmore concluded the memorial by saying despite the tragedy, JJ and Tylee\u2019s deaths have brought people together and the children are resting in the arms of a loving Jesus Christ.\n\n\u201CYou have an extended family from all over the world.\u201D Cudmore said. \u201CNothing can separate us from the love of God.\u201D\n\n\u25BA Support East Idaho News: https://www.eastidahonews.com/donate/\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on X: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #trial \n\nBOISE \u2014 Judge Steven Boyce sanctioned a Mountain Home lawyer Thursday afternoon for filing a late night error-filled motion asking to intervene in the murder case of Chad Daybell.\n\nBoyce told attorney Terry Ratliff he was angry when the motion was filed \u201Cand I think I\u2019m angrier now\u201D during the tense 20 minute hearing in Ada County.\n\nRatliff filed the motion to intervene and continue the trial on Friday, March 29 at 11:42 p.m., just two days before jury selection was set to begin in the case. Several words were misspelled \u2013 including \u201Cmotion,\u201D \u201Ccontinue,\u201D \u201Cproceedings\u201D and Ratliff had the case number wrong, according to Boyce. He also claimed three times in the motion that he represented Daybell as his defense attorney, but that was not true.\n\nThe filing was entered into the iCourt system on Sunday, March 31 \u2013 hours before potential jurors were scheduled to arrive at the courthouse. Boyce, his staff and attorneys have spent the previous week going through juror questionaries in Boise.\n\n\u201COn Easter Sunday, my staff attorney, who had an opportunity finally to travel home and spend Easter with her family after a very long week, was interrupted out of her church services,\u201D Boyce said. \u201CShe contacted the court and said we had an emergency. The emergency was we had a motion to continue the trial.\u201D\n\nBoyce had to contact the prosecution and defense and work with court clerks to deal with the motion. He immediately sealed it and a hearing was later scheduled for Thursday. The motion was still sealed as of Thursday afternoon when Ratliff showed up with his attorney, Michael Bartlett.\n\n\u201CWhile I appreciate the time and research Mr. Bartlett has put into the case, we don\u2019t have a party appearing in this case before me. You are not the defendant, you are not the state, you are not the prosecutor, you are not the defense attorney,\u201D Boyce said to Ratliff. \u201CYou are an attorney with a license who filed something asking me to stop this trial when I don\u2019t think you had legal standing to do that\u2026I\u2019m going to tell you Mr. Ratliff, I was angry then and I think I\u2019m angrier now about what you did.\u201D\n\nBoyce told Ratliff he had some questions for him \u2013 not his attorney \u2013 because he was the one who filed the motion on his official letterhead. Ratliff said he made an error in claiming to be Daybell\u2019s defense attorney.\n\n\u201CThis is a template form and I simply forgot to take it off,\u201D Ratliff said. \u201CIn the body of the motion, I say I am filing it without permission of the defendant or his counsel.\u201D\n\nBoyce asked who he was representing. Ratliff responded he should have signed the motion as \u201Ccitizen.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou\u2019ve got your name, your Idaho state bar number, your Ratliff Law Office and attorney for defendant. You\u2019re telling me you mistakingly filed something as a citizen and not an attorney?\u201D Boyce asked. \u201CWhy were you doing that on a Friday night at almost midnight?\u201D\n\nRatliff responded that he needed to do something to slow the case down to which Boyce replied, \u201CThis trial is scheduled for how many years and you wanted to slow it down the day before it started?\u201D\n\nRatliff told Boyce he had received calls from defense attorney John Prior about possibly helping in the case but admitted he was never retained as counsel. When Ratliff mentioned he wanted to intervene as \u201Ccitizen at large,\u201D Boyce asked why he filed as an attorney. Ratliff responded that it was semantics, to which Boyce interjected.\n\n\u201CWhoa \u2013 let me stop you there. It absolutely is not. A bar-licensed attorney filing something with their bar number is completely different than a citizen. That is not semantics,\u201D Boyce said.\n\nWhen asked to explain the misspellings and errors, Ratliff said he was nervous, it was late at night and he \u201Cdidn\u2019t take this lightly.\n\n\u201CYou didn\u2019t take it lightly but you used the wrong form, you misrepresented if you were an attorney or a citizen and you signed three times you were an attorney for the defendant,\u201D Boyce said.\n\nThe judge ruled Ratliff violated the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure and sanctioned the attorney. He was ordered to reimburse the defense, prosecution and court for time spent working on the motion.\n\nAs Bartlett asked to interject at the end of the hearing, Boyce said, \u201CYou may not. I\u2019m done with this issue and I\u2019m done wasting time on this issue in the middle of a capital case. We\u2019re done. We\u2019re in recess. Period.\u201D\n\nBartlett and Ratliff had no comment.\n\n\u25BA Support East Idaho News: https://www.eastidahonews.com/donate/\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on X: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #truecrime \n\nBOISE -- Chad Daybell discussed finances with his daughter and told her he \u0022wasn\u0027t coming back\u0022 after being taken into custody the morning human remains were found buried on his property.\n\nFor the first time, police video footage from inside a patrol car was shown during Daybell\u0027s trial Monday morning. The video is from June 9, 2020 and was recorded shortly after deputies found the body of Joshua \u0022JJ\u0022 Vallow.\n\nRexburg Police Det. Eric Wheeler testified that as police searched Daybell\u0027s property, he watched from inside his vehicle parked in the driveway. He then drove the car to his daughter\u0027s home, which was kitty corner from his, and about 60-90 minutes later, took off in the vehicle.\n\nOfficers followed the car, pulled Daybell over and put him in the back seat of Wheeler\u0027s police vehicle. They allowed his daughter, Emma Murray, to speak with him and a portion of the conversation was played during court.\n\n\u0022They said I could talk with you and I didn\u0027t want you to be alone,\u0022 Murray says through tears. \u0022I love you so much.\u0022\n\nDaybell thanks his daughter for coming over and then discusses finances for several minutes. He tells her there is $9,000 cash in a drawer inside his home and explains how much is in different bank accounts.\n\nHe tells Murray how to log into his Telmate account, a system used to communicate via phone or video with incarcerated inmates. Daybell regularly spoke with his wife, Lori Vallow Daybell, who was at the Madison County Jail.\n\n\u0022She\u0027ll need to still have commissary money. I usually put $30 a week on there. You can probably talk to her too,\u0022 Daybell tells Murray.\n\n\u0022It sounds like you\u0027re not going to be out for a little while,\u0022 Murray tells her dad. He laughs and responds, \u0022I\u0027m not coming back. All that stuff in the baby room is Lori\u0027s and mine...Just put it in the garage.\u0022\n\nAround 20 minutes of footage was played in court but Fremont County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Rocky Wixom said the entire video is over an hour.\n\nDaybell was taken to the Fremont County Jail shortly after his conversation with Murray but before he is taken away, he says, \u0022I\u0027m sorry. We will get through this.\u0022\n\nWatch the portion of the video that was played in the court in the player above.\n\n\n\u25BA Support East Idaho News: https://www.eastidahonews.com/donate/\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on X: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #dateline \n\nBOISE \u2014 Ever since the Daybell case broke over four years ago, Keith Morrison has had one question: was Chad Daybell leading Lori Vallow along or was it the other way around?\n\nThe \u201CDateline NBC\u201D correspondent hopes he will learn the answer as Chad Daybell\u2019s trial begins this month in Ada County.\n\n\u201CThe real puzzle for me has always been who was driving the bus. Was it Chad and his way out there ideas he published and she decided was the most wonderful thing she\u2019d ever heard as he told her she was a goddess so she bought into it and went along with what she wanted? Or was she manipulating him? I don\u2019t know,\u201D Morrison tells EastIdahoNews.com.\n\nThe veteran journalist has been following the case closely since December 2019 and says few other stories he\u2019s covered in his career \u201Ccould ever loom larger\u201D in his memory than this one.\n\n\u201CThere are a few that come close, but this is a pretty extraordinary tale,\u201D he explains.\n\nChad Daybell is charged with multiple crimes, including conspiracy to commit murder and first-degree murder. He has pleaded not guilty. Lori Vallow Daybell was found guilty of similar charges last year and is serving three life sentences without the possibility of parole. The charges are in relation to the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2014 two of Lori\u2019s kids \u2014 and Chad\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\n\u201CDateline\u201D has produced multiple programs and the \u2018Mommy Doomsday\u2019 podcast over the years as the Daybell case has unfolded. Morrison was in Hawaii before Chad and Lori were arrested and has witnessed the shocking twists and turns including the discovery of JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan buried on Daybell\u2019s property and the fact Tammy Daybell died of asphyxiation.\n\n\u201CChad had just been so circumspect the whole time. I doubt very much that he will testify. Why would he? I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t but boy, would I love to see that,\u201D Morrison says. \u201CHe laid out so much of his odd philosophy in the things he wrote about and the physical evidence in this case is so overpowering and so disturbing that I\u2019m going to be very interested in what his defense could possibly be.\u201D\n\nMorrison is convinced Chad and Lori are \u201Ctrue believers\u201D in the theology they espouse and is fascinated by the dynamic in the couple\u2019s relationship.\n\n\u201CAs we looked into her background, you could see she would habitually develop incredible enthusiasm for a new person in her life. The early parts of those relationships were intense and then later they would all fall apart in rancor,\u201D Morrison explains. \u201CChad had been laconic for a long time with his wife that to have that sudden intensity inserted into his life had to have changed him. I can see him feeling like he was carried along helplessly on the power of her magnetism and the fact she seemed to be in love with him. He became putty in her hands. That\u2019s what makes you wonder \u2013 who really was behind this?\u201D\n\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Support East Idaho News: https://www.eastidahonews.com/donate/\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on X: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "title": "Death penalty in Idaho: Lori Vallow Daybell defense attorney John Thomas explains",
      "description": "#eastidahonews #deathpenalty #daybell \n\nBOISE \u2014 Chad Daybell could face the death penalty if he is found guilty of murdering his first wife, Tammy Daybell, and Tylee Ryan and Joshua \u201CJJ Vallow, two children belonging to his current wife Lori Vallow Daybell.\n\nCertain qualifications must be met in order for prosecutors to seek the death penalty in Idaho.\n\nJohn Thomas, one of Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s attorneys, sat down with EastIdahoNews.com to answer some frequently asked questions about the death penalty in the Gem State.\n\nWhat does it take to be a death penalty-qualified attorney in Idaho?\n\nYou can either be a first or second chair death penalty-qualified attorney in Idaho. If you\u2019re a first chair, you\u2019re in charge of the defense. A second chair assists.\n\n\u201CIn order to become a first chair, you have to sit on a death penalty case as a second chair attorney and then you move up,\u201D Thomas explains.\n\nIf a defense attorney wants to become death penalty certified, they fill out an application detailing how many felony cases they have tried in court. It\u2019s vetted by a group of attorneys and if approved, a mentor is assigned.\n\nJim Archibald, Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s other attorney, was Thomas\u2019s mentor.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019ve done probably five or six death penalty cases together. None of them have gone all the way to trial. We were thinking Lori Vallow might go all the way to trial but a few weeks before it started, we ended up getting death penalty off the table,\u201D Thomas says.\n\nHaving the death penalty removed was a win for Thomas and Archibald and they say any time they can have the life of their client spared from execution, it\u2019s a victory worth noting.\n\nWhat kind of cases qualify for death penalty in Idaho?\n\nThere has to be a homicide and certain qualifiers must be in place for prosecutors to seek the death penalty.\n\n\u201CThere could be a mass shooting where more than one person dies. There could be something specifically atrocious and cruel in the way they killed the person,\u201D Thomas says. \u201CIf the person has a high propensity to kill again or if there is a death involving a police officer in Idaho, they automatically go for the death penalty. Also if you kill someone while you\u2019re an inmate in prison, you\u2019re automatically qualified for death.\u201D\n\nThere are other qualifications, according to state law, and prosecutors must declare within 60 days of arraignment if they intend to seek the death penalty.\n\nWhat are the differences in death versus non-death trials?\n\n\u201CDeath penalty is just different,\u201D Thomas says. \u201CYou get a lot more leeway in your defense. You can ask a lot more questions, you can put on a lot more witnesses, everything is on the table in a death penalty case.\u201D\n\nA mitigation expert is hired to assist the defense in death penalty cases. The expert researches everything about the defendant and their background. They \u201Cturn it upside down and shake it out,\u201D Thomas says.\n\nThere are two tracks in death penalty cases. The pre-conviction phase \u2013 where the jury decides if the defendant is guilty or guilty \u2013 and the punishment phase, where they determine if the defendant gets life in prison or death.\n\nDefense attorneys and prosecutors have to be ready for both phases and different witnesses could be called either phase.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019ll have a majority of the witnesses on your witness list who will be for the penalty phrase. Those are witnesses who will be able to tell the story of the person who was convicted of first-degree murder,\u201D Thomas explains.\n\nThe penalty phase could take a week or two and the jury is sequestered. Once the second phase of the trial is over, the jury deliberates and every juror must agree the defendant should die or a sentence of life in prison is imposed. Judges do not declare the punishment in a death penalty case.\n\nWhen someone receives the death penalty, why does it take years before they are executed?\n\nThere are mandatory appeals that must be filed before someone is put to death. There are other appeals attorneys will often file and Thomas says that keep safeguards in place.\n\n\u201CIt takes a lot to kill a person and if the state and government is going to take someone\u2019s life, we want to make sure absolutely that this person actually did it,\u201D Thomas says.\n\nRead more here: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2024/04/death-penalty-in-idaho-defense-attorney-john-thomas-explains/\n\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Support East Idaho News: https://www.eastidahonews.com/donate/\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on X: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #jury \n\nBOISE \u2014 A man who served on the jury in the Lori Vallow Daybell case plans to attend Chad Daybell\u2019s trial as it gets begins this week in Ada County.\n\nTom Evans was Juror #18 and was one of the twelve jurors who found Lori Vallow Daybell guilty of murdering her two children, Joshua \u201CJJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan, and conspiracy to commit the murder of JJ, Tylee and Tammy Daybell, her husband\u2019s former wife.\n\nJury selection in the trial of Chad Daybell, Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s husband, begins Monday morning. He faces similar charges including the murder of Tammy Daybell.\n\nEvans had never served on a jury when he was summoned to the Ada County Courthouse in April 2023 and knew very little about the Daybell case.\n\n\u201CI just thought it was business as usual at the courtroom. There were tons of jurors called in, but I didn\u2019t know they were all for one trial and had no idea what was going on,\u201D Evans recalls. \u201CIt was really hard. I\u2019m used to being outside and not used to hanging out inside a small room with a bunch of people.\u201D\n\nFor five weeks, Evans spent his days in a courtroom. Some of the evidence was \u201Chorrific\u201D as prosecutors showed autopsy photos and played emotional audio recordings.\n\nEvans says there wasn\u2019t a particular piece of evidence or \u201Csmoking gun\u201D that made him think Vallow Daybell was guilty; rather, it was a compilation of witness testimony.\n\n\u201CThey found her hair between the plastic and the duct tape on JJ\u2019s body. That didn\u2019t mean much to me because it\u2019s a mom\u2019s hair and it\u2019s going to be everywhere,\u201D Evans explains. \u201CTo me, it was an accumulation of things. What\u2019s weird to say is a lot of the witnesses that had been her friend had more influence on me in making my decision than all of the police, FBI and professional people who testified.\u201D\n\nThe trial took an emotional toll on Evans and he tells EastIdahoNews.com he feels like he\u2019s finally \u201Cgetting back to myself\u201D a year later. The court offered to pay for counseling if jurors requested services but for Evans, his way of dealing with the aftermath was writing a book about his experience. It\u2019s called \u201CMoney, Power and Sex\u201D and will be released when Chad Daybell\u2019s trial is over. All proceeds will be donated to charity, Evans says.\n\nEvans feels for the jurors in the new trial as they will determine whether Chad Daybell will get the death penalty if he is found guilty. For Evans, he would have sentenced Lori Vallow Daybell to death if it was an option.\n\n\u201CI would have had no issue,\u201D he says. \u201CIf somebody does the things they did, they deserve to die and I\u2019m all for the death penalty in that way. Still, it would have been tough.\u201D\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Support East Idaho News: https://www.eastidahonews.com/donate/\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on X: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #rubyfranke #bodycam\n\nNewly released police body camera video shows police searching Ruby Franke\u0027s home and finding a scared child in a closet.  \n\nCASE SUMMARY\n\nRuby Franke was once best known for her popular YouTube channel on which she documented family life with her husband and six children. On December 18, 2023, however, she pleaded guilty to four counts of aggravated child abuse. On December 27, 2023, Jodi Hildebrandt, a licensed therapist who ran an online self-improvement program with Ms. Franke, also pleaded guilty to four counts of aggravated child abuse. Four months earlier, the women were arrested after Ms. Franke\u2019s 12-year-old son climbed out of the window of Ms. Hildebrandt\u2019s Ivins, Utah residence, ran to a neighbor\u2019s home, and asked for help. The neighbor observed duct tape on the boy\u2019s ankles and wrists, severe wounds, and malnourishment. He quickly contacted law enforcement who, upon arrival, learned that potentially more children remained inside Ms. Hildebrandt\u2019s home and in harms\u2019 way. The officers responded to Ms. Hildebrandt\u2019s home, placed her under arrest, and conducted a search of her sizable property where they found Ms. Franke\u2019s 9-year-old daughter, petrified and hiding in a closet.\n\nThe ensuing investigation revealed that Ms. Franke and Ms. Hildebrandt held Franke\u2019s 12-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter in a work-camp like setting. The children were regularly denied food, water, beds to sleep in, and virtually all forms of entertainment. They were also prohibited from interacting with others and were hidden in the home when others came to visit. They were forced to do physical tasks like carrying loaded boxes up and down stairs and \u201Csitting\u201D against a wall without a chair or stool for hours at a time. The children were also forced to do manual labor outdoors in the extreme summer heat without shoes or socks. They were similarly forced to stand outside, on a cement patio, in the summer heat for hours and even days. They were beaten, and the 12-year old was bound hand and foot after a previous attempt at running away. Additionally, the children suffered emotional abuse to the extent that they came to believe that they deserved the abuse.\n\nThe investigation found that religious extremism motivated Ms. Franke and Ms. Hildebrandt to inflict this horrific abuse. The women appeared to fully believe that the abuse they inflicted was necessary to teach the children how to properly repent for imagined \u201Csins\u201D and to cast the evil spirits out of their bodies.\n\nOn February 20, 2024, Judge John J. Walton of Utah\u2019s Fifth Judicial District Court sentenced Ms. Franke and Ms. Hildebrandt to serve four to thirty years in the Utah State Prison, the maximum sentence for this type of an offense. Because of Utah\u2019s indeterminate sentencing laws, the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole now oversees the length of their prison sentence.\n\nThe Washington County Attorney\u2019s Office is grateful for the law enforcement officers, medical personal, case workers, Children\u2019s Justice Center staff, and others who were instrumental in ensuring the children\u2019s safety and administering justice to their abusers.\n\nRead the latest on the case here: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2024/03/i-will-not-feed-a-demon-youtuber-ruby-frankes-child-abuse-case-rooted-in-religious-extremism/\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Support East Idaho News: https://www.eastidahonews.com/donate/\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on X: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #rubyfranke #doorbellcam \n\nJodi Hildebrandt, Ruby Franke\u0027s friend, calls her attorney as police show up to search her home. This newly released video shows police body camera footage as they take action.\n\nCASE SUMMARY\n\nRuby Franke was once best known for her popular YouTube channel on which she documented family life with her husband and six children. On December 18, 2023, however, she pleaded guilty to four counts of aggravated child abuse. On December 27, 2023, Jodi Hildebrandt, a licensed therapist who ran an online self-improvement program with Ms. Franke, also pleaded guilty to four counts of aggravated child abuse. Four months earlier, the women were arrested after Ms. Franke\u2019s 12-year-old son climbed out of the window of Ms. Hildebrandt\u2019s Ivins, Utah residence, ran to a neighbor\u2019s home, and asked for help. The neighbor observed duct tape on the boy\u2019s ankles and wrists, severe wounds, and malnourishment. He quickly contacted law enforcement who, upon arrival, learned that potentially more children remained inside Ms. Hildebrandt\u2019s home and in harms\u2019 way. The officers responded to Ms. Hildebrandt\u2019s home, placed her under arrest, and conducted a search of her sizable property where they found Ms. Franke\u2019s 9-year-old daughter, petrified and hiding in a closet.\n\nThe ensuing investigation revealed that Ms. Franke and Ms. Hildebrandt held Franke\u2019s 12-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter in a work-camp like setting. The children were regularly denied food, water, beds to sleep in, and virtually all forms of entertainment. They were also prohibited from interacting with others and were hidden in the home when others came to visit. They were forced to do physical tasks like carrying loaded boxes up and down stairs and \u201Csitting\u201D against a wall without a chair or stool for hours at a time. The children were also forced to do manual labor outdoors in the extreme summer heat without shoes or socks. They were similarly forced to stand outside, on a cement patio, in the summer heat for hours and even days. They were beaten, and the 12-year old was bound hand and foot after a previous attempt at running away. Additionally, the children suffered emotional abuse to the extent that they came to believe that they deserved the abuse.\n\nThe investigation found that religious extremism motivated Ms. Franke and Ms. Hildebrandt to inflict this horrific abuse. The women appeared to fully believe that the abuse they inflicted was necessary to teach the children how to properly repent for imagined \u201Csins\u201D and to cast the evil spirits out of their bodies.\n\nOn February 20, 2024, Judge John J.

JJ Vallow died on or around Sept. 23, 2019 and Tammy Daybell died Oct. 19, 2019 in her Salem home. The remains of Tylee and JJ were found buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s property on June 9, 2020.\n\nRELATED | Documents detail horrific manner JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan were found in Chad Daybell\u2019s yard\n\nIf the alleged crimes happened in Fremont County, why is the trial being held in Ada County?\n\nDistrict Judge Steven Boyce granted a change of venue motion in Oct. 2021 and moved the trial to Ada County after John Prior, Chad\u2019s attorney, argued pre-trial publicity would affect the ability to find a fair and impartial jury in Fremont County.\n\nChad and Lori\u2019s trials were joined until March 2023, when Boyce severed the cases.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t Lori Vallow Daybell on trial?\n\nAfter Judge Boyce severed the cases, a continuance was granted for Chad\u2019s trial. Lori\u2019s trial was held last spring in Ada County and a jury found her guilty on all charges. She was ordered to serve three life prison sentences without the possibility of parole.\n\nWhere is Lori Vallow Daybell now?\n\nAfter being sentenced, Lori Vallow Daybell was booked into the Pocatello Women\u2019s Correctional Center. In November, she was extradited to Arizona, where she is currently in the Maricopa County Jail on charges of conspiracy to commit murder for her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and former nephew, Brandon Boudreaux.\n\nWhere can I watch Chad Daybell\u2019s trial?\n\nJudge Boyce is allowing the trial to be livestreamed using court cameras and equipment.

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #trial \n\nIDAHO FALLS \u2014 Larry Woodcock knows this trial will be different.\n\nFor one, the man accused of killing his grandson, JJ Vallow, and the boy\u2019s sister, Tylee Ryan, is facing the death penalty.\n\nThe trial will also be live streamed for the world to watch.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest difference for Woodcock is while he knew Lori Vallow \u2014 JJ and Tylee\u2019s mother \u2014 he has never met Chad Daybell and doesn\u2019t know much about him.\n\n\u201CI was angry at Lori \u2014 that she would do something and participate in something like this,\u201D Woodcock tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CI really don\u2019t have a lot of feelings about Chad. I\u2019m angry at him, sure, and I certainly share no love for him. But it\u2019s just a really different set of feelings.\u201D\n\nDaybell, who married Lori Vallow two weeks after his wife Tammy Daybell died in October 2019, is charged with conspiracy to commit murder and first-degree murder in relation to the deaths of Tammy, JJ and Tylee. Jury selection for his trial is scheduled to begin April 1 in Ada County.\n\nLori Vallow Daybell was found guilty of similar charges last year and is serving three life sentences without the possibility of parole. She is currently in an Arizona jail on charges of conspiracy to commit the murder of Charles Vallow, her fourth husband, and Brandon Boudreaux, her former nephew-in-law.\n\nChad Daybell has pleaded not guilty, but Woodcock believes prosecutors will prove their case and a jury will find the Salem father committed the horrific crimes.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m totally confident that he\u2019ll be found guilty,\u201D Woodcock says. \u201CIf you took a picture of Chad on April 1 in court and you found a picture of him four years ago when he was in court, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any change. His demeanor hasn\u2019t changed, his attitude hasn\u2019t changed \u2013 he\u2019s so blas\u00E9 and just a wimp of a man.\u201D\n\nWoodcock and his wife, Kay Woodcock, will travel from their home in Louisiana to attend the trial in-person every day. They were in the courtroom daily during Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s trial last spring, although Kay Woodcock did not attend when autopsy photos and other graphic evidence was presented.\n\n\u201CThere are some things she doesn\u2019t need to see and I think that\u2019s one of the bonds I have with the jurors because they had to see what I chose to see,\u201D Larry Woodcock says. \u201CThat reinforces my desire for an honest, fair trial. When you\u2019ve seen those photographs and the gravity of them, you want things done right. You don\u2019t want a sloppy job. We want the prosecutors and defense to do the best that they\u2019re able.\u201D\n\nChad Daybell\u2019s trial is expected to last eight to 10 weeks. If the jury finds him guilty, Daybell could be sentenced to life in prison or the death penalty. Woodcock hopes Daybell is given life without parole.\n\n\u201CThere are certain things in life I think are worse than death. Life in prison without the possibility of ever getting out and dying in prison may be worse than death,\u201D Woodcock says. \u201CI certainly don\u2019t wish him the best.\u201D\n\nEastIdahoNews.com will livestream proceedings daily and will be in the courtroom when jury selection begins April 1. Reporter Nate Eaton will recap the events of each day during \u201CCourtroom Insider,\u201D a program livestreamed weeknights from Boise at 6:30 p.m. MDT.\n\nWatch our entire conversation with Woodcock in the video player above.\n\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

She carried a locked black box with her and when she was processed in the jail, deputies asked her to open it.\n\nDaybell entered the combination from the box and the deputy pulled out the following items:\n\n-Headphones\n-Charging cable for a laptop\n-Two hard drives with connecting cables\n-Another connecting cable\n-Two flash drives\n-an HP laptop with a label attached that said property of Mark Means\n\nMeans was Daybell\u0027s attorney in Idaho until December 2021.\n\nFour notebooks were also found in the black box.\n\nDaybell was allowed to have a laptop in Idaho to review evidence as she prepared for trial.\n\nThe items were put back into the black box and Daybell locked it before deputies said they were going to admit into storage for safe keeping. They told Daybell that it could be picked up by someone who gave them the proper form.\n\nDaybell remains in the Maricopa County Jail awaiting trial.\n\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#daybell #best #court \n\nDRIGGS \u2014 Teton County Prosecuting Attorney Bailey Smith is requesting help in a triple murder case from a Missouri lawyer who has played a prominent role in the Chad and Lori Daybell cases.\n\nRachel Smith, who is not related to Bailey Smith, signed an engagement agreement with the Teton County Commissioners and was approved to begin working on the Jeremy Best murder case once the Idaho courts admit her pro hac vice.\n\nPro hac vice is a legal term for adding an attorney to a case in a jurisdiction where they are not licensed to practice.\n\nBest is accused of killing his wife Kali Randall, their unborn baby, and their son, 10-month-old Zeke Best, in December. He was indicted by a grand jury in Teton County for three counts of first degree murder and three enhancements for the use of a firearm or other deadly weapon during the commission of a crime. If convicted, he could face up to the death penalty.\n\nRachel Smith has been working with Madison County Prosecuting Attorney Rob Wood and Fremont County Prosecuting Attorney Lindsay Blake on the Daybell cases since being hired by Wood in March 2021. Rachel Smith announced last week she was stepping down effective Feb. 28, but EastIdahoNews.com has learned her withdrawal from the Daybell cases is not related to her joining the Best case.\n\n\nBailey Smith is the only full-time prosecutor in Teton County and handles all felony crimes. The engagement agreement says the prosecuting attorney \u201Cneeds additional attorney assistance and seeks an attorney experienced with homicide cases and complex litigation.\u201D\n\nThe Missouri attorney has over 25 years of experience working more than 100 homicide, death penalty and other complex criminal cases in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nRachel Smith will be an independent contractor with Teton County and be paid $150 an hour plus reimbursement for legal research fees not handled by Bailey Smith\u2019s staff.

Chad is also charged with two counts of insurance fraud in relation to Tammy Daybell\u2019s life insurance policies.\n\n\u201CMr. Daybell does not have the ability to pay for counsel\u2018s continued services and Mr. Daybell seeks the appointment of two capital qualified attorneys to represent him in this matter,\u201D Prior wrote in a motion filed Thursday afternoon. \u201CThis motion is made with Mr. Daybell\u2019s full consent. Mr. Daybell has requested from me that he be given two capital qualified attorneys for his trial.\u201D\n\nPrior noted the complexity of the case would require him to work \u201Caround the clock, more than full-time for more than four months without compensation and without the assistance of any other counsel.\u201D\n\n\u201CI have made a diligent effort to find a lawyer to assist in this matter for a significant amount of time. The attorney who I located and agreed to try to get qualified has not yet been approved by the Public Defense Commission. The time for him to be of any assistance to me in preparing for this trial is long gone,\u201D Prior wrote.\n\nProsecutors filed their intent to pursue the death penalty in Daybell\u2019s case in August 2021. Prior has solely represented his client since being hired over three years ago.\n\nJury selection for Daybell\u2019s trial is scheduled to begin less than three months from now on April 1 in Ada County. If District Judge Steven Boyce grants Prior\u2019s request to withdraw from the case, new attorneys would be appointed and there could be significant delays in the trial start date.\n\n\u201CAfter speaking with Mr. Daybell, I have confirmed that he is unable to pay any additional funds, and he believes it would be a disservice for me to continue to represent him in a capital case and trial without compensation,\u201D Prior wrote.\n\nLori Vallow Daybell was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison without parole last summer. She is currently in Arizona on charges of conspiracy to commit murder of Charles Vallow, her fourth husband, and Brandon Boudreaux, her former nephew-in-law. Once court proceedings are done in Arizona, she will return to Idaho to serve her life sentence.\n\nA hearing on Prior\u2019s motion to withdraw is scheduled for Thursday, Jan. 18 at 10 a.m.\n\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

She said her name and birthdate when a judge asked and the court issued a not guilty plea on her behalf.\n\nA grand jury indicted Daybell in June 2021 after her brother, Alex Cox, shot and killed her then-husband Charles Vallow in his Chandler home. Cox died in December 2019 from what a medical examiner deemed to be natural causes.\n\nA second grand jury indictment was filed in Feb. 2022 for conspiracy to commit the murder of Brandon Boudreaux. At the time, he was married to Melani Pawlowski, Daybell\u2019s niece. Police say Cox shot at Boudreaux and tried to kill him.\n\nDaybell was extradited to Arizona last week from the Pocatello Women\u2019s Correctional Center, where she has been since the beginning of August after Judge Steven Boyce sentenced her to life in prison for the murders of her children, Tylee Ryan and Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow.

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #coroner\n\nST. ANTHONY \u2013 Brenda Dye says she still has nightmares about the Chad and Lori Daybell case.\n\nThe 46-year-old Island Park woman is in her second term as Fremont County coroner. She was involved in the death investigation of Chad Daybell\u2019s wife, Tammy, and Lori\u2019s kids, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow.\n\nDye tells EastIdahoNews.com it\u2019s \u201Cby far the most difficult\u201D case she\u2019s ever been involved in.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s just hard to imagine someone doing that to someone they care for and love,\u201D Dye says. \u201CI have kids and I just can\u2019t imagine what the family has had to go through.\u201D\n\nMany were horrified by the images of Tylee and JJ\u2019s bodies presented in court during Lori\u2019s murder trial. Both bodies were found buried in Chad\u2019s backyard in June 2020. JJ was wrapped in plastic and bound by duct tape, while Tylee was dismembered and burned.\n\nA jury found Lori guilty of murder in May. She is serving three life sentences at the Pocatello Women\u2019s Correctional Center. She was extradited to Arizona earlier this week to answer for the alleged murder of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow. She made her initial court appearance in Maricopa County on Thursday in front of Judge Tracy R. Nadzieja.\n\nOfficials determined Tammy died of asphyxiation. Bruises found on her arms and chest suggest she may have been restrained.\n\nThroughout this ordeal, Dye says many people have asked her about the case. One of the questions she\u2019s asked most often is how she\u2019s dealt with it.\n\nThe ability to emotionally detach is a skill Dye says is critical in maintaining professionalism. Despite years of training, she struggled and had to seek professional help to deal with her emotions.\n\n\u201CI still have nightmares,\u201D says Dye. \u201CEvery time we have a new trial (Chad\u2019s trial begins in April), I have to relive everything again and all those emotions come back. A lot of cases are harder than others, but this has been really hard for me.\u201D\n\nDye was months into her first term when Tammy died and the kids disappeared. Her first two cases in office involved people she knew, which made dealing with the Daybell case even more difficult.\n\nAnother case around the same time involved the death of a family friend.\n\n\u201CI have two sons and one of their friends ended his life,\u201D she says.\n\nThe timing of these situations made 2019 one of the most difficult years of her life.\n\nWATCH OUR INTERVIEW WITH DYE IN THE VIDEO ABOVE.\n\nREAD THE FULL STORY ON OUR WEBSITE HERE: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2023/12/coroner-involved-in-daybell-case-speaks-on-camera-for-the-first-time-says-it-still-gives-her-nightmares/\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahone...\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.co...\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newslet.",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #trial\n\nST. ANTHONY -- Prosecutors in the Chad Daybell murder case are asking a judge to move his trial from Ada County back to eastern Idaho.\n\nDistrict Judge Steven Boyce granted a request in October 2021 from John Prior, Daybell\u0027s defense attorney, to relocate the trial due to extensive media coverage and concerns over finding an impartial jury. \n\nDaybell\u0027s trial is scheduled to begin April 1 but Lori Vallow Daybell\u0027s trial was held in Ada County this spring. In a renewed motion to reconsider change of venue filed Wednesday afternoon, Fremont County Prosecuting Attorney Lindsey Blake and Madison County Prosecuting Attorney Rob Wood argued that \u0022local media and community participation in Ada County itself was pervasive and extensive.\u0022\n\n\u0022Given this significant change in circumstances and information not in existence at the time this Court entered the original order changing venue, this Court choosing to modify its decision regarding the change of venue is appropriate and necessary,\u0022 Blake wrote.\n\nDaybell is charged with multiple crimes, including conspiracy to commit murder and first-degree murder. The charges are in relation to the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2014 two of Lori\u2019s kids \u2014 and Chad\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\nIn their filing, prosecutors say a fair and impartial jury can be found in Fremont County and that\u0027s where the trial should be as all three bodies were found deceased on Daybell\u0027s property, which is in the county. \n\n\u0022The fact the co-defendant\u0027s trial was in Ada County now creates a more difficult process of selecting a jury in that venue in relation to the defendant\u0027s case,\u0022 Blake wrote. \u0022The co-defendant\u0027s trial did not take place in Fremont County, and the extensive media coverage associated with the co-defendant\u0027s trial was not present in Fremont County.\u0022\n\nProsecutors note there was intense media coverage in Ada County during Lori\u0027s trial and interviews, statements and live news coverage were conducted outside the courthouse.\n\nEast Idaho News is also referenced in the prosecutors\u0027 filing, referring to Boyce\u0027s earlier change of venue ruling in which he stated extensive coverage from our outlet could impact potential jurors living in eastern Idaho.\n\n\u0022There was nothing to support or establish where those who follow the stories reside or are located. In fact, East Idaho News has taken over coverage of this story, and has viewers nationally and internationally,\u0022 Blake wrote. \u0022Furthermore, East Idaho News was a consistent and strong presence during the trial in Ada County, and after the trial conducted interviews with some of the jurors. The same rationale that applied at the time the Court ordered the change of venue now applies - but in relation to Ada County.\u0022\n\nShould Boyce not want to move the trial back to Fremont County, prosecutors ask him to reconsider a venue that is \u0022closer, less saturated and less expensive.\u0022\n\nIn a second motion also filed Wednesday, Boyce and Wood renewed their objection to having cameras in the courtroom during Daybell\u0027s trial.\n\nPrior has asked for cameras and says his client wants \u0022a public trial.\u0022\n\n\u0022Excessive prejudicial pretrial publicity will negatively impact the parties\u2019 right to trial created by the improper use of camera and audiovisual equipment in sensitive pretrial hearings,\u0022 Blake wrote in the filing. \u0022Due to the pre-trial publicity that has already occurred, and the trial of Lori Daybell, the State is concerned about the ability to pick a fair and impartial jury in Chad Daybell\u2019s case in Ada County.\u0022\n\nProsecutors note that cameras will \u0022complicate\u0022 jury selection because there will be pre-trial publicity and could affect witness testimony.\n\n\u0022Being called as a witness in a murder trial is in and of itself daunting. Knowing that potentially millions of viewers may scrutinize every word you say and your appearance is exponentially more daunting,\u0022 Blake wrote.\n\nA hearing on the cameras and other motions is scheduled to be held Nov. 29 in Fremont County.

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #crime \n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 Chad Daybell\u2019s attorney is asking a judge to take the death penalty off the table in his client\u2019s case because he says Daybell is less culpable than his wife, Lori Vallow Daybell, who did not face the death penalty.\n\nLori and Chad were indicted by a grand jury in May 2021 on multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan \u2014 two of Lori\u2019s kids \u2014 and Daybell\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell. Chad is also charged with two counts of insurance fraud in relation to Tammy Daybell\u2019s life insurance policies.\n\nLori was found guilty in May and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Until a few weeks before the trial, she faced the death penalty but District Judge Steven Boyce removed it as a possible sentence for multiple reasons. Lori refused to waive her right to a speedy trial and due to a \u201Cvoluminous\u201D amount of discovery and evidence turned over by prosecutors a month before proceedings were scheduled to begin, her attorneys argued they could not adequately prepare for a death penalty trial.\n\nChad waived his right to a speedy trial and in an 11-page motion to strike the death penalty filed Thursday, defense attorney John Prior wrote Lori \u201Cset the conspiracy in motion, manipulated both Alex Cox and Chad Daybell, and remained in charge of her plan throughout.\u201D\n\n\u201CLori \u2018manipulated Chad through emotional and sexual control\u2019 and \u2018Chad [was] not going to act without Lori saying so,\u0027\u201D Prior said, quoting from a transcript of her trial. \u201CPer the state\u2019s own presentation of evidence and arguments in the trial of Lori Vallow, Mr. Daybell has lesser culpability than his co-defendant, who did not face the death penalty.\u201D\n\nPrior wrote that even if two co-defendants are equally culpable, it is \u201Cunconstitutional and unacceptable\u201D for one of them to receive the most extreme punishment available while the other does not.\n\n\u201CThe state has presented evidence and argued that Lori was the leader of the alleged conspiracy, and Chad only followed Lori\u2019s direction,\u201D Prior wrote. \u201CEven if all of the state\u2019s allegations were accepted as true\u2026he is the co-defendant facing the most extreme punishment available.

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #appeal \n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s attorney has filed an appeal and is asking the Idaho Supreme Court to examine her case, guilty verdict and sentence.\n\nDaybell was ordered to life in prison without parole in July for killing her two youngest children, 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan, as well as conspiring to kill Tammy Daybell, her fifth husband\u2019s then-wife.\n\nIn a notice of appeal filed Thursday, Jim Archibald, Daybell\u2019s lawyer, asked the Supreme Court to consider 16 issues, including:\n\nWhether District Judge Steven Boyce erred in finding Daybell competent for trial after she spent 10 months in a mental hospital\nWhether Boyce erred in denying Archibald\u2019s request to send Daybell back to the mental hospital rather than proceeding to trial\nWhether Daybell\u2019s constitutional rights to a speedy trial were violated by the prosecutor\u2019s requests for continuances\nWhether Boyce erred when he allowed prosecutors to present evidence of crimes in the pending Arizona case concerning the death of Charles Vallow (Daybell\u2019s fourth husband) and the attempted murder of Brandon Boudreaux (Daybell\u2019s former nephew-in-law)\nWhether Boyce abused his discretion by sentencing Daybell to serve three consecutive fixed life sentences without parole\nWhether Boyce abused his discretion by ordering Daybell, who is indigent and has a public defender, to pay $165,018 in fines and court costs\nRELATED | Lori Vallow Daybell was convicted of murder. Her attorneys are asking for a new trial.\n\nArchibald also filed a request asking the state to appoint appellate public defenders to take over the appeal portion of the case.\n\nAppeals of felony convictions, especially in murder cases, are common. They must be filed within 42 days of sentencing. A transcript of Daybell\u2019s trial will now be prepared for the Supreme Court, and Archibald is also requesting transcripts of Daybell\u2019s competency hearings, pretrial hearings and the sentencing hearing.\n\nThe appellate process can be lengthy and may take several years. The Idaho attorney general will assign a lawyer to represent the prosecution, and that attorney, along with the defense appellate attorney, will prepare written briefs and likely present oral arguments before the state Supreme Court issues its decision.\n\nThere could be some delays in Daybell\u2019s appellate case as the state of Arizona plans to extradite her on conspiracy to commit murder in Vallow\u2019s death and for the attempted murder of Boudreaux.\n\nDaybell was booked into the Pocatello Women\u2019s Correctional Center a month ago. The trial for Chad Daybell, her husband, is scheduled to begin April 1 in Ada County.\n\nRead the entire appeal here: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2023/09/read-lori-vallow-daybells-notice-of-appeal/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #doomsday \n\nIDAHO FALLS \u2014 One of Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s close cousins is shedding new light on her doomsday beliefs and the influence Chad Daybell may have had on her in the months leading up to the deaths of her children.\n\nBraxton Southwick lived within an hour of Lori\u2019s family growing up and is similar in age to her and her brother Adam. He tells EastIdahoNews.com they were \u201Cas close as cousins could be\u201D but really connected in 2001.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ve always kind of been a prepper but really got into it after the 9/11 terrorist attacks,\u201D Southwick says. \u201CI\u2019d say Lori started prepping a lot around the same time. We talked a lot about prepping. I\u2019d call her and say, \u2018Hey, have you read this book?\u2019 and she\u2019d call me, \u2018Have you read this book?\u2019 We kind of fueled the fire for passion and prepping with each other.\u201D\n\nSouthwick appeared on two seasons of hit National Geographic show \u2018Doomsday Preppers,\u2019 has been on multiple television programs discussing prepping and has traveled to several states speaking about preparing for the end of times.\n\nHe says Lori wasn\u2019t into collecting food storage, fuel or physical items because she moved a lot but focused on spiritual, religious preparation. Southwick recalls visiting Hawaii with his wife in 2017 and staying at Lori and Charles Vallow\u2019s home for a week.\n\n\u201CPretty much all we did was talk about prepping the whole time \u2013 books, our feelings about things \u2013 it was just something fun for us,\u201D Southwick explains. \u201CIt was huge in her life to be a part of it and experience it firsthand. That was what she really, really wanted.\u201D\n\nAround the time of their visit, Lori became obsessed with \u2018Visions of Glory,\u2019 a book detailing near-death experiences and visions of a man as told to the author. It describes a plague, floods, earthquakes and the gathering of 144,000 righteous people ahead of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.\n\n\u201CI thought it was a phenomenal book\u2026but you just have to keep it vanilla. What she did was take it to the way extreme and she (believed) a lot of stuff out of that book. We talked about that book all the time and I think I\u2019m the one that called her and told her about it when it first came out,\u201D Southwick says.\n\nWhen Kauai police served Lori with an order to produce her children in January 2020, body camera footage shows her lying next to a swimming pool with a \u2018Visions of Glory\u2019 book on her chair. Chad Daybell is in a chair next to her.\n\nRead the entire story here: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2023/08/lori-vallow-daybells-cousin-who-starred-in-doomsday-preppers-sheds-new-light-on-her-beliefs-and-chad-daybells-influence/\n\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #prison\n\nPOCATELLO \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell spent her first night in a cell at the Pocatello Women\u2019s Correctional Center (PWCC) on Tuesday, but she could be moved to another part of the prison in the coming weeks.\n\nThe facility sits on top of a hill overlooking Pocatello and holds around 355 women, who are referred to as residents rather than inmates. It\u2019s the largest women\u2019s prison in the state, with the population consisting of everyone from low-risk offenders to Robin Row, the one woman in Idaho on death row.\n\nIdaho Department of Correction policy prohibits employees from discussing specific residents, but PWCC Warden Janell Clement spoke with EastIdahoNews.com Wednesday about the intake process for those sentenced to prison.\n\n\u201CThey come on a bus from a county jail and go through our receiving area in intake. They are given clothing items, and they\u2019ll be met by a case manager and have a nursing assessment,\u201D Clement says. \u201CFrom there, they will be moved down to a housing unit. Over the next 14 days to four weeks, they\u2019ll be given different assessments through dental, medical, mental health and case management needs to assess what they may need during their stay.\u201D\n\nResidents can attend high school and college courses while incarcerated. Employment opportunities are available, including cleaning the building, sewing clothes, working in the kitchen and doing other jobs.\n\nAlthough Daybell is now the most well-known resident at PWCC, Clement says she\u2019s just like everyone else.\n\n\u201CEveryone\u2019s treated fairly and respectfully, and their confidentiality is maintained. They\u2019re going to go through that same process as anyone else,\u201D she says.\n\nDaybell was sentenced to serve a fixed life sentence at PWCC but officials in Maricopa County, Arizona, say they plan to extradite on two conspiracy to commit murder charges. That could happen anytime within the next few months.\n\nClement says there are a lot of stigmas associated with prison, and the public rarely hears positive aspects of the system. It can be a place that rehabilitates residents and helps them lead a more productive life.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019re working really hard to help people return back to society \u2013 to be a better member of society, a better neighbor, a better friend,\u201D she says. \u201CThey\u2019re moms, they\u2019re daughters, they\u2019re sisters. We\u2019re working to help change people\u2019s lives and impact them so they can return back to their families and communities.\u201D\n\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #trial \n\nIDAHO FALLS \u2014 Kay Woodcock barely slept Sunday night as she put the finishing touches on a victim impact statement she read during Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s sentencing Monday.\n\nIt ended up being 18 pages, but due to a variety of reasons, some of it could not be read to District Judge Steven Boyce in court. During an interview with EastIdahoNews.com Tuesday, Woodcock shared her favorite section from the statement that she was unable to give.\n\n\u201CThere was my favorite line in the whole statement and I couldn\u2019t say it. I wanted to tell the judge \u2013 please do not give her even the slightest bit of hope for leaving prison in anything other than a body bag,\u201D Woodcock says. \u201CThat was the best I could hope for. And he did it. So she will be leaving it in a body bag \u2013 just however long it takes for her to get into one.\u201D\n\nLarry and Kay Woodcock, JJ Vallow\u2019s grandparents, have attended most of Daybell\u2019s court hearings over the past 3 1/2 years. They admit they\u2019ve been outraged, disappointed, discouraged and baffled at times as they\u2019ve worked to obtain justice for their grandson, his sister, Tylee Ryan, and Tammy Daybell. However, they are pleased Boyce sentenced Daybell to serve life in prison without parole.\n\n\u201CPeople ask all the time, \u2018How are you so patient?\u2019 Well, we haven\u2019t been patient. Sometimes you just have to choose to accept it the way it is and things will happen in time,\u201D Kay Woodcock explains. \u201CWe were constantly reminded all of this is in God\u2019s time, not our time. I would say that over and over and over. Unless you want it to eat your insides out, you have you accept it and wait.\u201D\n\nThe Woodcocks will now wait for court proceedings to begin in Arizona, where Daybell faces two conspiracy to commit murder charges, and Chad Daybell\u2019s trial, which is scheduled to begin in Ada County on April 1.\n\nKay Woodcock would like him to take a plea agreement and serve life in prison but Larry Woodcock wants a jury to decide Chad Daybell\u2019s fate.\n\n\u201CI want him in trial. It can take a month, two months, three months, we\u2019ll be there. We want him in front of jurors. I want him to try to lie his way out of this,\u201D Larry Woodcock says. \u201CDo I think he\u2019s going to speak? No. I somewhat believe at this point that he\u2019s going to have to look in the mirror and come to a realization of what\u2019s happened.\u201D\n\nThe Woodcocks live in Lake Charles, Louisiana but say Idaho feels like their second home. They say the love they have felt has been a bright spot during their real-life nightmare and they appreciate everyone\u2019s support.\n\n\u201CThe words of encouragement, the prayers \u2013 it\u2019s amazing. I just sometimes think, why are we so blessed? What did we do to deserve the blessing of the world?\u201D Larry Woodcock says. \u201CIt\u2019s amazing to me.

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #vallow\n\nIDAHO FALLS \u2014 Summer Shiflet was not surprised when her sister Lori Vallow Daybell was sentenced to serve life in prison without parole Monday and believes justice was served for Tylee Ryan, JJ Vallow and Tammy Daybell.\n\nShiflet has not done any media interviews since her niece and nephew were found buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s property in June 2020 and her sister was charged with killing them and conspiring to kill Tammy Daybell.\n\nShiflet spoke on Zoom with EastIdahoNews.com from her Arizona home hours after Lori Daybell read a statement at her sentencing and said Jesus Christ \u201Cknows that no one was murdered in this case.\u201D A presentence investigative report was referenced at the hearing that reportedly said Daybell suffers delusional disorder with grandiose features.\n\n\u201CI have known she\u2019s been in this delusion for a while. It took me a long time to accept that and understand what was going on,\u201D Shiflet explained. \u201CI had never seen anybody with a delusion disorder before. I didn\u2019t know how to process that or what it looked like (but) that\u2019s about typical of most conversations with her. It\u2019s about her faith and there\u2019s never any acknowledgment of what actually happened. You can\u2019t ever really get any answers so it leads to frustrating situations.\u201D\n\nShiflet believes her sister started experiencing delusions in late 2017 or early 2018 but she \u201Ccherry-picked\u201D different religious experiences to share with certain family members. During her statement Monday, Daybell stated that while giving birth to Tylee, she died, chatted with deceased family members and spoke with Jesus Christ before her spirit returned to her body.\n\n\u201CShe has never once told me that she had a near-death experience when she was giving birth to Tylee and left her body and saw my sister Stacey,\u201D Shiflet says. \u201CThat has never been talked about ever by her with us.\u201D\n\nShiflet says parts of Daybell\u2019s statement were true, such as the fact Tylee suffered from severe pancreatitis and was abused by her biological father Joseph Ryan, who died in April 2018. Colby Ryan, Daybell\u2019s oldest son, has publicly spoken about the abuse.\n\nThe life sentence was \u201Cbittersweet\u201D for Shiflet and her family but it\u2019s what they expected, she says. She did not attend her sister\u2019s sentencing but sent a victim impact statement to Judge Steven Boyce.\n\n\u201CI know from my own experience in writing to Lori and talking to Lori \u2013 she\u2019s not open to hearing what I\u2019m saying. She is not responsive to the things I\u2019m saying. I knew anything I said there would fall on deaf ears to her,\u201D Shiflet explains. \u201CI wanted the judge to know how I felt for purposes in doing his sentencing.\u201D\n\nDuring the hearing, Kay Woodcock spoke about her grandson JJ Vallow. Memories and thoughts of Tammy were shared by her sister, Samantha Gwilliam, and aunt, Vicki Hoban. Shiflet says had she attended, she would have spoken about Tylee and read the following statement:\n\nWe knew on June 9, 2020 that this day would come. While we knew and tried our best to prepare for today, it has still been difficult and heartbreaking. I have lost a sister to a long, horrible illness, and I can honestly say that it is more painful to lose a sister in this way, to severe mental illness. And there are just no words to express the pain of knowing what happened to Tylee and JJ.\n\nWe heard some powerful victim impact statements and many of them captured great qualities about Tammy, JJ, and Tylee. Our hearts go out to all of the family members that have been hurt and affected by these crimes. A lot of people have inquired about Tylee and we would like to share some of our experiences with her. While words can\u2019t do her justice, the beautiful girl that we know and love shines through our poor attempts to honor her.\n\nTylee Ashlyn Ryan was born Sept. 24, 2002. Making her my almost birthday twinner, as I was born Sept. 23 at 11:55 p.m. She was a tiny baby, just over 5lbs, and had beautiful dark hair. I lived in a different state, so I didn\u2019t get to see her nearly enough, but when I did see her, she was a happy baby with beautiful pink cheeks, fierce blue eyes, and her hair had lightened to a soft golden blonde.\n\nRead the rest of the story here: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2023/08/lori-vallow-daybells-sister-speaks-out-following-sentencing-shares-tribute-to-tylee-ryan/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell   #trial \n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell is scheduled to be sentenced on murder charges in ten days.\n\nJudge Steven Boyce will sentence Daybell, 50, in a Fremont County Courtroom at 9 a.m. on July 31. The hearing is not expected to last longer than one day, according to a news advisory from the Idaho Judicial Branch.\n\nA 12-person jury found Daybell guilty on May 12 of conspiracy to commit murder and the first-degree murder of her children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan. She was also found guilty of grand theft and conspiracy to commit the murder of Tammy Daybell, her husband\u2019s former wife.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the sentencing.\n\nCan I attend the sentencing or watch it live?\n\nSeating will be extremely limited inside the courtroom. Law enforcement, family members of victims and court personnel will have reserved seats. The remaining seats will be open to the public on a first come, first serve basis. A courtroom conduct order will be in effect for anyone who attends in-person.\n\nBoyce is allowing a livestream of the sentencing with courtroom cameras and audio. EastIdahoNews.com will provide the feed on our website, Facebook page and YouTube channel. The judge is also permitting one pool photographer to take pictures inside the courtroom on behalf of the media.\n\nWho will speak at the sentencing?\n\nThe prosecution and defense teams will provide sentence recommendations. Kay Woodcock, JJ Vallow\u2019s grandmother, is expected to give a victim impact statement, along with Samantha Gwilliam, Tammy Daybell\u2019s sister, and Vicki Hoban, Tammy Daybell\u2019s aunt. Other victims may also speak or submit letters to the judge.\n\nLori Daybell will be given the chance to make a statement if she wishes.\n\nBoyce will hand down his sentence once everyone has spoken.\n\nWhat type of sentence could Lori Vallow Daybell receive?\n\nDaybell faces 10 years to life in prison on each of the murder and conspiracy to commit murder charges. She could be sentenced 1-20 years in prison on the grand theft charge.\n\nIf Boyce hands down a \u201Cfixed\u201D sentence, Daybell will not be eligible for parole until the time has been completed. If she is sentenced to a fixed life sentence, she will never be eligible for parole.\n\nAn \u201Cindeterminate\u201D consists of a range of years that is not a fixed time. For example, if Daybell is sentenced to an indeterminate 10-20 years, she could be released from prison at any point during that time.\n\nWhat happens to Daybell after she is sentenced?\n\nOnce Daybell is sentenced, she will be transferred from the Madison County Jail to the Pocatello Women\u2019s Correctional Center where she will become an inmate of the state of Idaho. Officials do not release any details about transportation plans so she could be moved immediately after the sentence or within a few days.\n\nCould Daybell appeal the verdict and sentence?\n\nDaybell can file an appeal within 42 days of being sentenced. She will be assigned appellate lawyers and it typically takes around three years for the case to move through the appellate courts. If she loses that appeal, she can file a second for ineffective counsel. That process could also take around three years.\n\nHow does the Idaho sentence affect Daybell\u2019s case in Arizona?\n\nDaybell faces conspiracy to commit murder charges in Arizona for the death of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and the attempted killing of her former nephew-in-law, Brandon Boudreaux.\n\nThe Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office has made the state of Idaho aware of its intent to prosecute Daybell in Arizona, according to a statement issued in May.\n\n\u201CAfter the defendant is sentenced and transferred to the Idaho Department of Correction, at the request MCAO, the extradition process will begin. The extradition can take from several weeks to several months,\u201D the statement said.\n\nDaybell does not face the death penalty in Arizona.\n\nHow does the sentence affect Chad Daybell\u2019s case and what is the status of his case?\n\nChad Daybell will not attend his wife\u2019s sentencing hearing but it\u2019s likely he will be able to view the proceedings from the Fremont County Jail. He faces similar charges and a jury trial is scheduled to begin in his case on April 1, 2024. He faces the death penalty.\n\n\u25BA Follow Nate Eaton on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/NateEatonReporter\n\u25BA Follow Nate Eaton on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/n.eaton/\n\u25BA Follow Nate Eaton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/NateNewsNow\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

ANTHONY \u2014 A court hearing in the Chad Daybell murder case was abruptly canceled Thursday morning.\n\nJohn Prior, Chad Daybell\u2019s attorney, had filed a motion asking for an official transcript and all exhibits from Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s trial. Prosecutors filed a response Wednesday saying they do not oppose the request. Because of the non-opposition, District Judge Steven Boyce vacated the hearing.\n\nChad and Lori Daybell were indicted by a grand jury in May 2021 on multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of JJ and Tylee \u2014 two of Lori\u2019s kids \u2014 and Daybell\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell. Chad is also charged with two counts of insurance fraud in relation to Tammy Daybell\u2019s life insurance policies.\n\nA 12-person jury found Lori guilty on all charges in May. She will be sentenced in Fremont County on July 31.\n\nChad\u2019s trial is scheduled to begin April 1 in Ada County. Lori also faces conspiracy to commit murder charges in Arizona for the death of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and the attempted killing of her former nephew-in-law, Brandon Boudreaux.",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #podcast \n\nIDAHO FALLS \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s brother and uncle are releasing a podcast and book to \u201Cfill the holes in a case that doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201D\n\nAdam Cox and Rex Conner have been working on \u201CTylee and JJ\u2019s Silver Linings,\u201D a 10-episode podcast, which will be available Friday. They aim to have a self-published book ready by the time Daybell is sentenced on July 31.\n\n\u201CThere are a lot of people who have different opinions about this case,\u201D Cox, Daybell\u2019s brother, tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CThis is a story and a case that doesn\u2019t make any sense (but) there are so many people at different levels of pain that we would like to just try to help those going through that.\u201D\n\nA jury found Daybell guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of her children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan, and conspiracy to commit the murder of Tammy Daybell, her husband Chad Daybell\u2019s then-wife. She also faces conspiracy to commit murder charges in Arizona for the death of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and the attempted killing of her former nephew-in-law, Brandon Boudreaux.\n\nCox has not spoken publicly since the verdict and has not talked to his sister in nearly four years. He and Charles Vallow were concerned for her mental well-being and wanted to get her help when Alex Cox, Lori and Adam\u2019s brother, shot and killed Vallow on July 11, 2019.\n\n\u201CTwo days later, I was driving to Tucson to my friend\u2019s house \u2026 and I said to him, \u2018Something weird is going on. I haven\u2019t heard from Charles,\u0027\u201D Cox recalls. \u201CIt wasn\u2019t like him not to text or call or anything. And so my friend said, \u2018What\u2019s his name?\u2019 I said, \u2018His name is Charles Vallow.\u2019 He gets on his computer and types \u2018Charles Vallow\u2019 and (a news story) said that Charles Vallow was shot and killed by his brother-in-law.\u201D\n\nCox remembers \u201Ccrying hysterically\u201D and getting a knot in his stomach. He drove to his parents\u2019 house and says there was a \u201Chuge argument\u201D because they were supporting Lori and Alex at the time.\n\n\u201CWhen the kids went missing \u2026 I had tried to talk to my family but they\u2019d cut me off completely,\u201D Cox says. \u201CMy first instinct when I heard they were missing was that the kids were dead. I told that to Rex, I told that to everybody because there\u2019s no way they\u2019re alive; otherwise, Lori would produce them.\u201D\n\nThe series of events caused a fracture in Cox\u2019s family. Alex Cox died in Dec. 2019 and after JJ and Tylee\u2019s remains were found buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s property in June 2020, Conner felt it was time to try and heal as much damage as possible.\n\n\u201CRex called me and said, \u2018I think it\u2019s time that we go to your mom\u2019s house, have a sit-down, and I\u2019ll be there to mediate,\u201D Cox says. \u201CThat was a very emotional day. A lot of feelings were said. \u2026 I told my mom and dad, \u2018I forgive you. Let\u2019s try to move forward.\u2019 So over the last two years, I\u2019ve been going to their house on Sundays to eat dinner.\u201D\n\nConner received some healing by attending parts of his niece\u2019s trial with his daughters in Boise this spring. He says he gained a greater appreciation for everyone involved in the case \u2014 from the prosecutors to defense attorneys and the judge, jury and media.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019re all united in finding justice for the victims of this tragedy. It\u2019s so uniting. We don\u2019t care what other people\u2019s politics are or their stance on social issues of the day. We\u2019re all united in wanting justice for these victims. That\u2019s a silver lining. I love that,\u201D Conner says.\n\nConner says prosecutors asked him to write a letter to Judge Steven Boyce offering his opinion of what type of sentence would be appropriate for Daybell. He says he was candid in expressing his thoughts.\n\n\u201CI said as someone who has known and loved Lori since the day she was born, it\u2019s painful for me to say this, but I don\u2019t believe she can be rehabilitated,\u201D Conner says. \u201CSo I would be concerned about her being around anyone outside of prison at any point in her life. \u2026 I was talking straight to the judge saying, \u2018This is the best I can do to tell you my own feelings.\u2019 We wouldn\u2019t know how to handle it if she were free amongst people and to be in her presence or to have the possibility of crossing her \u2014 that\u2019s just not something we want to deal with.\u201D\n\nRead the entire story here: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2023/06/lori-vallow-daybells-brother-and-uncle-speak-out-following-verdict-plan-to-release-podcast-and-book-about-ordeal/\n\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "title": "Juror responds after Lori Vallow Daybell\u0027s attorneys ask for a new trial",
      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #trial \n\nA man who served on the jury in Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s case is responding to a motion filed by her defense attorneys asking for a new trial.\n\nSaul Hernandez, Juror No. 8, spoke with EastIdahoNews.com five days after he and 11 other jurors found Daybell guilty of murdering two of her children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan. Daybell was also found guilty of conspiracy to commit the murder of Tammy Daybell, the former wife of Lori Daybell\u2019s husband, Chad Daybell.\n\nIn the motion for new trial filed Friday, Jim Archibald and John Thomas, Daybell\u2019s attorneys, claim Hernandez knew about evidence that wasn\u2019t presented during the trial and that instructions given to the jurors were confusing.\n\nThe lawyers cite a portion of Hernandez\u2019s interview with EastIdahoNews.com where he was asked about the efforts of law enforcement. Hernandez responded that police in Arizona had some \u201Csignificant red flags\u201D before and after Charles Vallow, Lori\u2019s fourth husband, was shot and killed by her brother Alex Cox.\n\n\u201CWe didn\u2019t consider this during our deliberations because it was clear to us. The instructions were clear. Arizona evidence and testimony is only for demonstrative purposes,\u201D Hernandez said.\n\nDuring the trial, Archibald and Thomas repeatedly objected to having evidence and testimony from the Arizona cases brought into Daybell\u2019s Idaho case. In their motion, they argue evidence regarding Arizona was not admitted for demonstrative purposes, as Hernandez said, but was evidence to show \u201Csome other reason other than bad character.\u201D\n\n\u201CTo confuse demonstrative evidence and character evidence is easy to do; hence, the defense objections should have been sustained,\u201D the attorneys wrote.\n\nThey also argue that Hernandez referenced evidence in Arizona that was not part of the Idaho trial.\n\n\u201CWe can only conclude that the juror relied on information not presented in court to reach his conclusion that Arizona dropped the ball and should have done more, even before Charles Vallow was shot and killed by Alex Cox,\u201D the attorneys wrote in their motion.\n\nIn a follow-up interview Tuesday, Hernandez said he was not aware of the Arizona video and information until he watched \u201CDateline NBC\u201D on May 14, two days after the trial ended. Our original interview with him was conducted in Boise on May 17.\n\n\u201COnce the verdict was final and we were released from court on Friday (May 12), as you can imagine, most people would have a bunch of questions in their mind,\u201D Herandez says. \u201COn Sunday, my wife said, \u2018Do you want to watch a new episode (of \u2018Dateline\u2019)?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Cool. Let\u2019s watch it.\u2019 Obviously, I was intrigued, and that\u2019s when I learned in Arizona there\u2019s footage from an encounter with Charles where he is clearly telling the police that his wife has deemed him a zombie. To me, those were significant red flags about something that\u2019s not normal.\u201D\n\nJurors were prohibited from consuming news coverage of the case during the trial but were allowed to watch and read whatever they want once a verdict had been reached, and the judge dismissed them. Hernandez says he \u201Cabsolutely\u201D followed the court rules and was respectful of the jury instructions presented by District Judge Steven Boyce.\n\nWhile Archibald and Thomas argue in their motion that those instructions were confusing, Hernandez says he and his fellow jurors understood them.\n\n\u201CI thought the judge gave us instructions through the trial, throughout the process, multiple times, and those instructions never changed even up until the very last day before the moment we were released to go and deliberate,\u201D he says. \u201CThose instructions were clear \u2026 and we used that set of instructions a number of times throughout the process of deliberation to go back and forth to make sure we understood exactly what the judge and the law and court allowed us to consider and what we were not allowed to consider.\u201D\n\nHernandez says he was surprised his comments were mentioned in the defense\u2019s motion, although he expected Daybell to appeal the verdict.\n\nRead the rest of the story here: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2023/05/juror-responds-after-lori-vallow-daybells-attorneys-ask-for-a-new-trial/?preview_id=599767\u0026preview_nonce=f5bfd09cf2\u0026_thumbnail_id=599797\u0026preview=true\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #moscow \n\nIDAHO FALLS \u2014 Keith Morrison has been closely following the Daybell case for three and a half years so when Lori Vallow Daybell was found guilty of murder last week, the \u2018Dateline NBC\u2019 correspondent was not shocked.\n\n\u201CYou always hold out a little possibility that there may be a wrinkle (on the jury), not necessarily because you want there to be one but you never know,\u201D Morrison tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CBut when they all came down guilty, it was not terribly surprising. You could almost hear a sigh of relief. People seemed to be very glad about those verdicts.\u201D\n\n\u2018Dateline NBC\u2019 has done several programs on the case since it broke in December 2019. While Morrison was familiar with a lot of the evidence and witnesses presented at trial, some memorable testimony stuck out to the veteran journalist.\n\n\u201CSome of the material was pretty extraordinary. The friend we hadn\u2019t talked to before \u2013 Audrey Barratarrio \u2013 was riveting and disturbing, to say the least,\u201D Morrison says. \u201CThe phone call with her sister from jail as she was waiting for events to occur, the lies she kept telling \u2013 it was quite phenomenal.\u201D\n\nBarratarrio testified that Daybell threatened to cut her up and kill her in 2019 after Tammy Daybell died and Daybell\u2019s children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan, vanished. They were eventually found buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s property.\n\nMorrison has also been busy following the murders of four University of Idaho students. Bryan Kohberger is accused of killing Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle, and Ethan Chapin on Nov. 13.\n\n\u2018The Killings on King Road\u2019 is scheduled to air Friday on \u2018Dateline NBC\u2019 and will reveal new information on the tragic case that has gripped the nation, according to Morrison.\n\n\u201CWe have learned some things about this case \u2013 the background and what was going on in Bryan Kohberger\u2019s life, what was going on in his family\u2019s life and what may have been happening as the police were finally closing in,\u201D Morrison explains. \u201CAll of these things are fascinating to know about but at the same time, we\u2019re being very careful to present these bits of information with the proviso that here\u2019s a man sitting in jail awaiting his trial before a jury of his peers and he is not guilty until proven otherwise.\u201D\n\nA grand jury indicted Kohberger this week and he will appear in court Monday where he will enter a plea during an arraignment.\n\nWatch our entire interview with Morrison in the video player above.",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #trial \n\nKAUAI, Hawaii -- Video of Lori Vallow Daybell being served with court documents as she and her new husband chilled by a pool in Hawaii has just been released.\n\nThe video was admitted in evidence during Daybell\u0027s trial last week as Kauai Police Department Detective Colin Nesbitt testified. Nesbitt served Daybell with the paperwork in January 2020. It demanded that Daybell produce JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan, her two missing kids, to a court or the Department of Health and Welfare in Rexburg within five days.\n\nThe children were found six months later buried on Chad Daybell\u0027s property.\n\nThe Kauai Police Department released the video Tuesday evening. After four weeks of testimony from 60 witnesses, the prosecution and defense rested in Daybell\u0027s case Tuesday. Jurors will be given instruction on Thursday before closing arguments. Deliberations will then begin.\n\nWatch the newly released video in the player above.\n\nRead all about the developments from the day here:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/news/daybell/\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

The mother of five was born May 4, 1970 and died in her Salem home on Oct. 19, 2019.\n\nWhile the country is focused on the murder trial surrounding her death, Daybell\u0027s family is inviting people from around the world to honor her through the Tammy Douglas Daybell Foundation.\n\nThe Foundation was established on the first anniversary of Daybell\u0027s passing to honor her life and legacy. The purpose is to assist libraries and support literacy programs in Utah and Idaho.\n\nEastIdahoNews.com reporter Nate Eaton spoke with Brooke Douglas Unti, Daybell\u0027s niece who serves as the foundation\u0027s media director. She explained how people can get involved and what the non-profit hopes to accomplish this year.\n\nWatch the interview in the video player above.\n\nLearn more about the Tammy Douglas Daybell Foundation here: https://www.tammydaybellfoundation.com",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #trial \n\nBOISE -- Christie Lott says seeing the autopsy photos of Joshua \u0022JJ\u0022 Vallow and Tylee Ryan was \u0022horrific\u0022 but brought her some closure.\n\nLott is Lori Vallow Daybell\u0027s first cousin. She, her two sisters and their father have attended Daybell\u0027s trial in Ada County every day this week. On Wednesday, jurors saw dozens of graphic photos showing the remains of JJ and Tylee but Judge Steven Boyce prohibited the public in the courtroom and overflow locations from seeing most of the images.\n\nAda County Forensic Pathologist Dr. Garth Warren described the grisly photos and after the trial was dismissed for the day, victims were permitted to meet with prosecutors to view them. Lott and one of her sisters did so.\n\n\u0022I\u0027m really glad they didn\u0027t show those pictures to the public. People shouldn\u0027t have to see them,\u0022 Lott tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u0022I wanted to do it to see for sure that it was them and they\u0027re gone. You would do that at a funeral. You want to say goodbye to a body and I don\u0027t know if we will get that chance any time soon.\u0022\n\nLott says it\u0027s been \u0022terrible, horrible yet healing\u0022 to be in the courtroom and see her cousin. They grew up together and there are many happy memories but it\u0027s surreal knowing Daybell is accused of murdering her children and Tammy Daybell, the former wife of her husband Chad Daybell.\n\n\u0022We are getting our own answers and we are getting to see that Lori is a totally different person,\u0022 Lott explains. \u0022It\u0027s hard because we love her but I feel like I\u0027m saying goodbye to her. I don\u0027t have to think about her anymore. It\u0027s like a funeral for Lori.\u0022\n\nRex Conner, Lott\u0027s father, chose not to view the autopsy photos. Out of the three days he\u0027s attended the trial, Wednesday was the hardest as most of the testimony focused on JJ and Tylee\u0027s remains.\n\n\u0022For a while there, I was barely holding it together. For me to deal with it, I have to disassociate myself from what I\u0027m seeing and that it\u0027s Tylee or JJ,\u0022 he says.\n\nConner and Lott say they appreciate the concern and love they have felt from everyone around the world and for the constant efforts of those who have spent years seeking justice on behalf of the victims.\n\n\u0022I\u0027m very grateful for all the people going through the process that have to see these things and are willing to talk about it in the trial,\u0022 Lott says. \u0022I hope justice is served to the best of its ability. I don\u0027t think Lori should be out on the street with normal people. It\u0027s going to be up to God what happens to her and I think that will be more satisfying to us than anything that can happen here at the courthouse.\u0022\n\nWatch our entire interview with Lott and Conner in the video player above.\n\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

Cox is Daybell\u0027s mom.\n\n\u0022What\u0027s hit me more than anything is an overwhelming feeling of gratitude to see how many people are involved in trying to get justice for Tylee and JJ and Tammy and Charles,\u0022 Conner told EastIdahoNews.com. \u0022I know a lot of people it\u0027s their job but...so many people are going above and beyond just the 9-5 aspect of it so it\u0027s very gratifying.\u0022\n\nConner says it\u0027s been a long-running family joke at how similar he and Alex Cox look. They were close until Cox \u0022converted to his new way of thinking,\u0022 Conner explains.\n\n\u0022It was a conversion. I only had two interactions after it happened and he was already a different person,\u0022 Conner says.\n\nConner describes the past four years as \u0022very difficult\u0022 and appreciates everyone around the world who has followed the case. He is praying justice will be served.\n\nWatch our entire interview with Conner in the video player above.",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #creepy \n\nREXBURG \u2014 Rick Robinson will never forget walking into an apartment on Pioneer Road in Rexburg on Jan. 21, 2020.\n\nAs a real estate agent, he was hired by the property owner to list the unit so Robinson wanted to check it out. He and his business partner had sold many apartments at the same complex so he didn\u2019t think anything of it until he entered No. 175.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ve been through thousands of homes but the second I walked into that place, it was just the darkest, creepiest feeling. You felt like you could cut the air with a knife,\u201D Robinson recalls. \u201CIt was the weirdest thing. I\u2019ve never felt this way when walking into a house and I remember just turning on lights because it almost felt like nothing would brighten that place up.\u201D\n\nRobinson didn\u2019t know Lori Vallow had been living in the apartment, which was empty and spotless. On that day, she was in Hawaii with her new husband Chad Daybell. Robinson had seen the news that her children, JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan, were missing but didn\u2019t make the connection this was her place until he entered the garage.\n\n\u201CThe last place I went was into the garage and that\u2019s when I saw that box with JJ on it,\u201D he tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CAll of a sudden, it just kind of dawned on me and I\u2019m like, \u2018No way. This can\u2019t be the place.\u0027\u201D\n\nRobinson pulled out his phone and took a photo of the box but forgot about it over the years until Thursday when David Warwick testified during Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s murder trial.\n\nWarwick described visiting Daybell at her apartment with Melanie Gibb, his girlfriend at the time, the weekend of Sept. 20, 2019. It was the first and only time he met JJ, Lori\u2019s 7-year-old son. He was playing with toys and Warwick tried to interact with him.\n\n\u201CHe had a cardboard box and was cutting doors and windows out of it \u2013 making a home out of it,\u201D Warwick said during his trial testimony. \u201CI got next to him and tried talking to him but \u2026 he was very focused on that and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all.\u201D\n\nPolice say JJ was killed that weekend and buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s property.\n\nRobinson was reading EastIdahoNews.com updates about the trial Thursday when he saw Warwick\u2019s testimony about the cardboard box and instantly remembered the photo on his phone.\n\n\u201CIt was the little cardboard house that he was cutting out with his name on it. There were probably four or five other boxes behind that (in the garage),\u201D Robinson says. \u201CThen it dawned on me that when I walked into the apartment, the front door jam was broken.\u201D\n\nDetectives testified they used force to break the door open when serving a search warrant at the property.\n\nRobinson shared the picture with EastIdahoNews.com including the date stamp that shows it was taken Jan. 21, 2020. Four days later, we confronted Vallow and Daybell in Hawaii about JJ and Tylee\u2019s whereabouts. The children were eventually found on Daybell\u2019s property in June 2020.\n\nAfter his initial visit to the Rexburg apartment in January 2020, Robinson says he made sure never to go back alone because it was the \u201Cdarkest\u201D place he\u2019s ever been.\n\n\u201CThere was something in that place that was just pure evil. That\u2019s the only way I can describe it,\u201D he says.\n\nWatch our entire interview with Robinson in the video player above.\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#daybell #trial #blessing \n\nBOISE -- Two weeks before Alex Cox died, Chad Daybell cried as he gave Cox a 15-minute patriarchal blessing promising that he was elect and a warrior for God.\n \nA patriarchal blessing is given to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by someone who has been asked to be a patriarch by church leaders. The patriarch gives promise, counsel, and lifelong guidance intended solely for the recipient. \n\nDaybell was giving the blessing to Cox on his own accord as it was not his calling within the church.\n\nDaybell laid his hands on Cox\u0027s head and gave him the blessing on Nov. 24, 2019. Cox\u0027s sister, Lori Vallow Daybell, was in the room for the blessing and can be heard saying \u0022amen\u0022 at the end. Cox died on Dec. 12, 2019.\n\nAn audio recording and written transcript of the blessing were admitted into evidence during Lori Daybell\u0027s murder trial Thursday. You can listen to the recording in the video player above.\n\nYou can find complete coverage of the case here:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/news/daybell/\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #trial \n\nBOISE -- Opening statements will begin Monday morning in the Lori Vallow Daybell murder trial and Larry Woodcock plans to be in court every day until a verdict is reached.\n\nWoodcock is Joshua \u0022JJ\u0022 Vallow\u0027s grandfather. JJ and his sister Tylee Ryan were found buried on Chad Daybell\u0027s Salem property in June 2020. Chad and Lori, the children\u0027s mother, are facing multiple charges in relation to JJ and Tylee\u0027s deaths and in connection to the death of Tammy Daybell, Chad\u0027s former wife.\n\nPolice began investigating the whereabouts of the children when Woodcock and his wife Kay Woodcock reported they were missing in November 2019. \n\n\u0022We are absolutely ready to attend this trial. We have waited for years and to say it\u0027s been an easy wait for us is a total understatement,\u0022 Larry Woodcock tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u0022We have gone through a tremendous amount of agony, we have cried, we\u0027ve had sad moments of joy (when) we found the children but were extremely disappointed in finding them deceased. But overall, I feel like we are prepared for this.\u0022\n\nThe Woodcocks traveled from their home in Louisiana to Boise, where they will stay for the duration of the trial. Extended family members plan to join them over the coming days and Kay Woodcock is expected to be called as a witness as early as this week. \n\nWoodcock says he has \u0022prayed heavily for the wisdom of the court to come through\u0022 for a fair and honest trial. During jury selection, prosecutors told potential jurors they will see autopsy photos of the children and \u0022emotionally charged\u0022 evidence. Woodcock says he is ready.\n\n\u0022I\u0027m prepared. The way I\u0027ll deal with it is...I have to put it in one of the post office boxes in my head and leave it there,\u0022 he explains. \u0022I have all these little post office boxes in my head and I open them up and put things in there and let them stay.\u0022 \n\nPeople around the world have expressed sympathy, condolences and love for the Woodcocks over the years. They feel like Idaho has become their second home and they are thankful.\n\n\u0022The support has been phenomenal. We never sought this. The only thing I ever asked from the first day was, \u0027Where are the children? Where are the children? Where are the children?\u0027 That\u0027s all I ever asked and this took off,\u0022 Woodcock says. \u0022The outpouring of support we have got is mind-boggling. It really is.\u0022\n\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #trial \n\nBOISE -- Reservations to get a seat in the courtroom for opening statements in the Lori Vallow Daybell trial were all taken in less than two minutes.\n\nThe public was able to log into an online system to reserve around 60 seats at 8 a.m. Friday. By 8:02 a.m., every seat had been claimed. A broadcast of the trial will be transmitted to an overflow room with around 200 seats in the Ada County Courthouse and a room in the Madison County Courthouse for those unable to get into the main courtroom.\n\nOpening statements will begin Monday at 8:30 a.m. after jury selection wrapped up Friday morning. The jury pool consists of ten men and eight women, including six alternates who will not be known until deliberations begin at the end of the trial.\n\nFourth District Administrative District Judge Steven Hippler tells EastIdahoNews.com courthouse staff has been planning for Daybell\u0027s trial for two years.\n\n\u0022We\u2019ve been working closely with Madison and Fremont County administration and all of our partners - the court\u0027s office, the sheriff\u0027s office, the trial court administrators - to make sure we have the resources and bandwidth to put on a trial like this,\u0022 Hippler says.\n\nAround 40 judges work in the Ada County Courthouse and there are 27 courtrooms. It\u0027s one of the biggest and busiest courthouses in the state but Hippler says he has never seen an interest in a case like the Daybell trial.\n\nEastern Idaho media outlets and reporters from Boise television stations and newspapers have been at the courthouse every day for jury selection. Producers and journalists from KSL in Utah, People Magazine, Court TV, Law and Crime and other national organizations have also attended, along with a dozen or members of the public each day.\n\n\u0022I\u2019ve certainly seen a lot of big trials and local media showing interest in those trials but in terms of the degree of national and international attention, in my ten years I\u2019ve not seen this,\u0022 he says.\n\nThe trial is expected to last up to eight weeks. Reservations open at 8 a.m. the day before each trial date and anyone wishing to attend in the courtroom or overflow locations must reserve a spot.\n\nEastIdahoNews.com reporter Nate Eaton has been in the courtroom all week and will provide live updates throughout each day.

Daybell is also charged with grand theft and conspiracy to commit murder for the death of her husband\u2019s previous wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\nLori Daybell\u2019s husband, Chad Daybell, faces similar charges but his trial has not yet been set.\n\nPotential jurors have been dropping off questionnaires at the Ada County Courthouse this week as District Judge Steven Boyce, defense attorneys and prosecutors prepare for jury selection starting Monday.\n\nJury selection\n\nThe public can observe a live video feed of jury selection in a room at the Ada County Courtroom and a room in the Madison County Courthouse. Boyce ruled that only potential jurors are permitted in the actual courtroom while the jury is being picked.\n\n\u201CThe potential jurors are called to the front of the room by the judge and the prosecution and the defense get a chance to ask them questions in a process called voir dire \u2013 a French word of meaning \u2018to see and to say,\u0027\u201D explains David Leroy.\n\nLeroy is a trial lawyer with five decades of experience who served as the Ada County Prosecuting Attorney, Idaho Attorney General and the Lt. Governor.\n\n\u201CThe idea is to ask people questions about whether they can be fair, impartial and objective jurors in this case and decide the case only on the evidence they hear in the courtroom,\u201D Leroy says.\n\nPotential jurors will likely be asked how much they know about the case, if their mind is made up, if they are related to anyone involved in the investigation and other questions.\n\n\u201CThe lawyers will have an opportunity to exercise what are called peremptory challenges, where they can decide that a particular juror might be less fair to their point of view and they can bump a certain number of people that way,\u201D Leroy says. \u201CWhile each side is looking for a fair and impartial juror, they\u2019re also looking for somebody who might tend to favor their particular point of view.\u201D\n\nRead the rest of the story here: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2023/03/final-preparations-underway-for-lori-daybells-trial-heres-what-you-can-expect-when-it-begins-monday/\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "title": "Your questions answered about the Lori Daybell trial",
      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #questions \n\nIt\u2019s a complex case involving multiple states, several law enforcement agencies, \u201Cvoluminous\u201D amounts of evidence and thousands of investigative hours. Now, after more than three years, the trial for Lori Vallow Daybell is finally scheduled to begin in Ada County on April 3.\n\nHere are some frequently asked questions and answers to get you up to speed on the eastern Idaho case that had made headlines around the world.\n\nWho is on trial and why?\n\nLori Vallow Daybell is on trial charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, and grand theft.\n\nShe and her husband, Chad Daybell, along with her brother, Alex Cox, are accused of killing Lori\u2019s children \u2014 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow \u2014 and Chad\u2019s former wife, Tammy Daybell. Alex Cox died in Dec. 2019.\n\nLori and Chad were indicted by a Fremont County Grand Jury in May 2021 on the following charges:\n\nConspiracy to commit first-degree murder and grand theft by deception for the death of Tylee Ryan\nFirst-degree murder for the death of Tylee Ryan\nConspiracy to commit first-degree murder and grand theft by deception for the death of JJ Vallow\nFirst-degree murder for the death of JJ Vallow\nConspiracy to commit first-degree murder in the death of Tammy Daybell, her husband\u2019s former wife\nGrand theft\nYou can read the indictment here.\n\nWhen and where did these alleged crimes occur?\n\nInvestigators believe Tylee Ryan was killed Sept. 9, 2019. JJ Vallow died on or around Sept. 23, 2019 and Tammy Daybell died Oct. 19, 2019 in her Salem home. The remains of Tylee and JJ were found buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s property on June 9, 2020.\n\nIf the alleged crimes happened in Fremont County, why is the trial being held in Ada County?\n\nDistrict Judge Steven Boyce granted a change of venue motion in Oct. 2021 and moved the trial to Ada County after John Prior, Chad\u2019s attorney, argued pre-trial publicity would affect the ability to find a fair and impartial jury in Fremont County.\n\nChad and Lori\u2019s trials were joined until March 2023, when Boyce severed the cases. The change of venue remains in effect for both trials.\n\nWhere can I watch the trial?\n\nBoyce has banned media cameras from broadcasting or livestreaming the trial. Members of the public can watch proceedings in the courtroom and an overflow location at the Ada County Courthouse. It will also be transmitted to a room in the Madison County Courthouse.\n\nHow long is the trial expected to last?\n\nThe trial, including jury selection and deliberations, could last up to ten weeks but will likely be shorter.\n\nHow many people are on the jury and when will they be chosen?\n\nTwelve people will serve on the jury and it\u2019s likely there will be at least two alternate jurors. Potential jurors who receive notices in the mail will report to the Ada County Courthouse on March 27 and 28 to complete questionnaires. Jury selection will begin on April 3 and it could take up to a week for a jury to be finalized.\n\nWho are Lori Daybell\u2019s attorneys?\n\nLori Daybell has two court-appointed attorneys. Jim Archibald has been a public defender for over 30 years and has been assigned to 27 murder cases. John Thomas has been a defense attorney since 2005 and previously worked as a prosecutor in Bingham County. He was a lawyer for Christopher Tapp, a man who served 20 years in prison after being wrongfully convicted of killing Angie Dodge.\n\nWho are the prosecutors?\n\nThere are three main prosecutors on the case. Madison County Prosecuting Attorney Rob Wood was elected in 2019 after serving as the county\u2019s Chief Deputy Prosecuting Attorney for ___ years. Fremont County Prosecuting Attorney Lindsey Blake was elected in 2021 after working as the Teton County Chief Deputy Prosecutor. Rachel Smith is a special prosecutor from Missouri with over 25 years of experience in homicide and death penalty cases.\n\nWho is the judge in the case?\n\nDistrict Judge Steven Boyce presides over the case. Idaho Gov. Brad Little appointed him to the bench in May 2019. Boyce practiced law in eastern Idaho for 20 years.\n\nRead the rest of the questions and answers at eastidahonews.com.\n\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #court \n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 The criminal cases against Chad and Lori Daybell have cost Idaho taxpayers over $3.6 million thus far, according to a public records request filed by EastIdahoNews.com.\n\nThe couple is charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2013 two of Lori\u2019s children \u2013 along with Chad\u2019s previous wife, Tammy Daybell. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Rexburg Police Department began investigating in November 2019 when Larry and Kay Woodcock, JJ\u2019s grandparents, requested a welfare check for their grandson. Since then, the Fremont County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies have been involved in the cases.\n\nEastIdahoNews.com asked Madison County, the city of Rexburg and Fremont County to provide an estimated cost of the cases between late 2019 and Dec. 2022.\n\nMadison County spent approximately $416,520\nThe city of Rexburg spent approximately $1,465,701\nFremont County spent approximately $1,750,000\nThe total amount spent between the three jurisdictions over the three years is approximately $3,632,221. This includes personnel, investigation costs and other expenses with law enforcement, the prosecution and public defenders.\n\nFremont County is currently paying all public defense fees but at the end of the trials, Madison County will reimburse for a portion of them, Madison County Clerk Kim Muir tells EastIdahoNews.com.\n\nCurtis Smith, a criminal defense attorney with Smith Woolf Anderson \u0026 Wilkinson in Idaho Falls, has not been involved in the cases but has been watching them closely. He says while the price tag may seem high, this situation is complex.\n\n\u201CThis obviously is such a unique case. It starts with the investigation of the missing children and it leads to a contempt order and pretty soon they\u2019re located in Hawaii,\u201D Smith explains. \u201CWe have to bring (Lori) back from Hawaii and once we get (her) here, we recognize the children are not going to be produced and that maybe something much more sinister is at play.\u201D\n\nThe cases turned into a murder investigation when JJ and Tylee\u2019s bodies were found buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s property in June 2020.\n\n\u201CA murder investigation itself can be very expensive, let alone when we are trying to find anything from murder weapons to the people who are missing,\u201D Smith says.\n\nDeath penalty cases, such as these, cost more to prosecute, according to Smith, and travel, exhibit costs, record expenses and evidence testing can be expensive.\n\nRexburg, Madison County and Fremont County have never had cases like this. Rachel Smith, a veteran homicide and death penalty attorney from Missouri, was brought in to help Madison County Prosecuting Attorney Rob Wood and Fremont County Prosecuting Attorney Lindsey Blake in 2021.\n\n\u201CAll of a sudden\u2026decisions have to be made (by prosecutors) about what kind of expertise do we need that we may not have on our current staff to help prosecute (this) case,\u201D Curtis Smith says. \u201CAnother prosecutor was brought in and that\u2019s not uncommon to happen, even in a larger county, let alone in a smaller county like Madison County.\u201D\n\nCOVID-19 and questions surrounding Lori Daybell\u2019s competency played a part in extending the case, factors Smith believes likely led to additional costs.\n\nUntil last week, Chad and Lori Daybell were set to have one trial together but Judge Steven Boyce severed the cases. Lori Daybell will now stand trial alone beginning April 3 in Ada County. Prosecutors argued against moving it to Boise and said in court hearings last year that it will cost Madison and Fremont Counties an estimated $600,000 more by relocating the trial to western Idaho.\n\nA trial date for Chad has not been scheduled but when the cases are over, taxpayers could end up paying at least $5 million \u2013 money the counties will likely never recoup.\n\n\u201CLet\u2019s assume that some big drug dealer comes to town and he\u2019s got a lot of things that you can forfeit. You can go after some forfeiture and maybe some automobiles and other things,\u201D Smith explains. \u201CEven in a drug case, it can be hard sometimes to recoup your money. But a murder case isn\u2019t like a drug case where there\u2019s a lot to forfeit or go after.\u201D\n\nThe Madison and Fremont County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, along with Lori and Chad Daybell\u2019s attorney, declined to comment on the cost of the investigation.\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "ST. ANTHONY \u2014 District Judge Steven Boyce made a major decision in the Chad and Lori Daybell case on Thursday. He severed the two defendants\u2019 cases, and they will now be tried separately.\n\nThe couple is charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2013 two of Lori\u2019s children \u2013 along with Chad\u2019s previous wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\nThe separation comes as a result of new DNA testing, which was just given to all parties involved in the criminal case. Since the results came back so close to the April 3 trial date, the defense attorneys for both Chad and Lori felt there was too little time for additional testing to be done on the sample.\n\nBoyce stated that because the evidence was not given to the defense by the state in a timely manner, and Lori has refused to waive her right to a speedy trial, he felt there was no option but to sever the cases.\n\nAs a result, Chad\u2019s trial has now been vacated from April 3 and will be rescheduled for a later date. But because Lori has not waived her right to a speedy trial, her court proceeding will continue as scheduled next month.\n\n\u201CI have to balance these rights of these defendants in this case,\u201D Boyce said. \u201CSeverance is the only option I see.\u201D\n\nBoyce expanded on the consequences of the severance, saying Chad\u2019s trial date could be scheduled as far out as six months from now.\n\n\u201CThe length of the delay, if I were to continue this, it would be up to Ada County and I don\u2019t believe it could be a short delay,\u201D Boyce said. \u201CIt would have to be more than six months additionally.\u201D\n\nThursday\u2019s hearing was a continuation of a discussion that began at a hearing on Monday regarding the new DNA evidence, which is hair that was found at the crime scene. During Thursday\u2019s hearing, Lori appeared in person, and Chad appeared from jail via Zoom.\n\nJohn Prior, Chad\u2019s attorney, also attended virtually from his Boise office. Prosecutors Lindsey Blake, Rob Wood, and Rachel Smith were in attendance, along with Jim Archibald, Lori\u2019s attorney. John Thomas, another of Lori\u2019s attorneys, was not present.\n\nPrior noted the importance of this new evidence and how crucial it is for his client to be able to have a fair trial, which would need to be held at a later date.\n\n\u201CThat evidence provides, at least from my perspective, an explanation potentially of where Mr. Daybell and I are going to go in this particular case,\u201D said Prior. \u201CI need to have an opportunity to test that evidence.\u201D\n\nArchibald agreed with Prior, saying that if he were in his shoes, he would do the same thing.\n\n\u201CIf my client waived her speedy trial, I would also be asking for extra time. But since she has held that right and held it close to her,\u201D said Archibald. \u201CI have to respect that constitutional autonomy that she has.\u201D\n\nBoth Lori and Chad have pleaded not guilty to all charges.",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #dna \n\nST. ANTHONY -- A sudden hearing Monday afternoon regarding DNA testing in the Chad and Lori Daybell case will continue Thursday in Fremont County.\n\nThe couple is charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2013 two of Lori\u2019s children \u2013 along with Chad\u2019s previous wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\nDistrict Judge Steven Boyce scheduled Monday\u0027s hearing on Friday afternoon after prosecutors received reports from a lab regarding evidence.\n\n\u0022We had a hearing last Thursday and at that time, the court was advised that some additional reports, as they relate to DNA evidence, were on the way but they had not yet been received by the prosecution,\u0022 Boyce said Monday. \u0022A report was received later that evening and disseminated to the court and defense counsel.\u0022\n\nChad and Lori appeared for the hearing via Zoom from the Fremont and Madison County Jails. John Prior, Chad\u0027s attorney, also attended virtually from his Boise office. Prosecutors Lindsey Blake, Rob Wood and Rachel Smith were in attendance along with Jim Archibald and John Thomas, Lori\u0027s attorneys.\n\nShortly after the proceedings started, Boyce said the new report may or may not be admitted into evidence. Because of that, he called for a portion of the hearing to be held privately without members of the public. Prior objected to closing the hearing.\n\n\u0022This could potentially taint jurors who could be called to serve in this case so it\u0027s necessary to seal the record and close the hearing for purposes of discussing candidly with counsel the DNA test report that was received,\u0022 Boyce said.\n\nEveryone in the courtroom was asked to leave for around 45 minutes until the closed portion was finished. Then, after being invited back into the courtroom for about 10 minutes during a recess, everyone was asked to leave again.\n\nApproximately 15 minutes later, the public was invited back to their seats and Boyce announced the remainder of the hearing would be postponed until Thursday.\n\n\u0022While the court was in recess, the court was advised of another additional report that came through regarding DNA evidence that was received by the state today,\u0022 Boyce said. \u0022In order to provide time to the defense and prepare the court, this hearing will be continued.\u0022\n\nThe next hearing will be held Thursday at 9:30 a.m. Cameras have not been allowed into proceedings since Boyce banned them last fall.\n\nThe trial for Chad and Lori Daybell is scheduled to begin April 3 in Ada County. They have pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #court \n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell walked into a Fremont County courtroom Thursday wearing a white blouse and black pants with a smile on her face and shackles on her ankles.\n\nHer husband, Chad Daybell, briefly smiled at her as he entered dressed in a white dress, red tie and ankle shackles.\n\nThe couple will stand trial together in seven weeks on multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2013 two of Lori\u2019s children \u2013 and Chad\u2019s previous wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\nDistrict Judge Steven Boyce heard several motions from defense attorneys and prosecutors regarding evidence, the jury, scheduling deadlines and whether Lori Daybell\u2019s case should be dismissed due to lack of a speedy trial.\n\nMotion to dismiss\n\nJim Archibald, Lori Daybell\u2019s defense attorney, argued that his client\u2019s constitutional rights are being violated as she will have been in jail 1,169 days by the time her trial begins April 3. Idaho law requires a trial be held within six months from the date a defendant is arraigned if that person does not waive their right to a speedy trial, which Daybell has not done.\n\n\u201CThe state acknowledges they are 44 days over (by the time the trial starts) but any amount of time over is a violation of speedy trial,\u201D Archibald said. \u201CThe defense knows it\u2019s outside the time of speedy trial, the state knows it\u2019s outside the time of speedy trial, so what\u2019s the remedy? The Idaho legislature says the remedy from the indictment is for it to be dismissed.\u201D\n\nFremont County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Tawnya Rawlings argued that Boyce determined \u201Cgood cause\u201D in previous hearings to delay the trial, such as scheduling conflicts with the Ada County Courthouse and questions surrounding Daybell\u2019s competency.\n\n\u201CI think it\u2019s important to note that Miss Vallow Daybell has concurred with the co-defendant\u2019s request to transfer the trial to Ada County. To keep the trials joined and in consideration of holding the trial in Ada County, a short postponement has not violated her rights,\u201D Rawlings said.\n\nBoyce said he will issue a written decision on the motion soon.\n\nJury motions\n\nBoyce granted a motion filed by Lori Daybell\u2019s attorneys to have instructions given to potential jurors before jury selection begins. Prosecutors agreed with the idea and Boyce said he\u2019s in process of coming up with those instructions. He will consider suggestions from both the defense and prosecution on what should be included.\n\nDaybell\u2019s attorneys also asked Boyce to allow individual voir dire, or examinations, when it comes to interviewing potential jurors.\n\n\u201CThis would be for sensitive matters, such as questions about punishment, mental health issues, domestic violence or religion, defense attorney John Thomas said. \u201CReligion is going to come out a lot at this trial and a lot of these allegations are about the LDS religion. We believe it\u2019s information we need.\u201D\n\nProsecutors did not object to individual voir dire but took issue with jurors being asked about their religious beliefs.\n\n\u201CThe state will be objecting to any questions about their religions or what congregations they attend,\u201D Madison County Prosecuting Attorney Rob Wood said. \u201CWe don\u2019t believe that\u2019s appropriate or relevant.\u201D\n\nBoyce granted the motion but said small groups will mainly be used when it comes to examining jury members and, if needed, potential jurors could be questioned privately.\n\nEvidence and witnesses\n\nThe original deadline for the defense and prosecution to submit evidence and witness lists to each other was Feb. 27 but John Prior, Chad Daybell\u2019s attorney, said he needs more time.\n\n\u201CThe concern is that from Dec. 25 until the present time, I was given five additional items of discovery. I need additional time for my experts to review it,\u201D Prior explained.\n\nPrior noted he and the prosecution are waiting on a piece of DNA evidence and once it\u2019s back, his expert will need 60 days to analyze it. That won\u2019t be enough time ahead of the trial.\n\nHe also mentioned 1,100 pages of documents that were given to him Thursday, which he has not had time to go through, and GPS evidence he recently received.\n\n\u201CThat GPA evidence is significant and it has taken a significant amount of time for my expert to evaluate that. I don\u2019t expect to receive that report for another week,\u201D Prior said. \u201CIf the court is going to insist on me going to trial, I\u2019m going to need some additional time.\u201D\n\nProsecutors suggested pushing back the deadline two weeks and Boyce set the new date for all evidence and witnesses to be submitted as March 13.\n\nA motion to sever the cases from each other, filed by Prior, was postponed until the next court hearing scheduled for Feb. 23.\n\nChad and Lori Daybell have pleaded not guilty to all charges.",

It said:\n\nLaurel Trimble and Georgann Roberts are the head secretaries at Rocky Mountain Middle School. Laurel has been there for 27 years and Georgann for 29 years. They are both retiring at the end of this month. These women have given dedicated service to many students and staff through the years.

      "description": "#daybell #eastidahonews #trial \n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell is asking a judge to dismiss her case because she has yet to have a jury trial.\n\nDaybell will have been in jail 1,169 days by the time her trial begins, according to her defense attorneys Jim Archibald and John Thomas, and in a motion filed Thursday, they argue her constitutional rights have been ignored.\n\n\u201CIt is undisputed that Lori Vallow Daybell has demanded her speedy trial and has never waived her constitutional rights,\u201D Archibald wrote. \u201CShe is prejudiced every day since she\u2019s in jail and unable to post a bond. The court has repeatedly reminded the government that it will respect her constitutional right to a speedy trial.\u201D\n\nDaybell and her husband Chad Daybell are charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2013 two of Lori\u2019s children \u2013 along with Chad\u2019s previous wife, Tammy Daybell. A trial for the couple is scheduled to begin on April 3 in Ada County.\n\nDaybell was arrested in February 2020 and flown from Hawaii to Madison County where she was booked into jail. A grand jury indicted her on murder charges in May 2021 and her case was put on hold pending competency issues.\n\nShe was found competent in April 2022 but competency issues were again raised in October 2022, so the case was again paused for another month.\n\n\u201CA 40-day delay caused by the competency review still doesn\u2019t justify a trial setting three years after her arrest and almost one year after her arraignment,\u201D Archibald wrote. \u201CThe government still has an obligation to bring her to a speedy trial which complies with the Constitutions and the Idaho Code.\u201D\n\nIdaho law requires a trial be held within six months from the date a defendant is arraigned if that person does not waive their right to a speedy trial.\n\n\u201CFrom her arrest on Feb. 20, 2020. until the current trial setting on April 3, 2023, is 1,169 days without a trial,\u201D Archibald wrote. \u201CHer constitutional rights, including her right to be presumed innocent and her right to a speedy trial, have been ignored by the government.\u201D\n\nDaybell and her husband are scheduled for a joint trial. It was supposed to begin this month but John Prior, Chad Daybell\u2019s attorney, asked District Judge Steven Boyce to postpone the start date. Chad Daybell has waived his right to a speedy trial and Boyce has mentioned in more than one court hearing that the length of Lori Daybell\u2019s incarceration is \u201Cconcerning\u201D to him.\n\nDaybell\u2019s attorneys argue that because their client has not gone before a jury, Boyce should drop the charges.\n\n\u201CThe government cannot show \u2018good cause\u2019 to bring Lori Vallow Daybell to trial over three years from her arrest and almost one year from her arraignment. This court should find that the government has not met its burden to uphold her constitutional rights. This case should be dismissed,\u201D Archibald writes.\n\nSubpoenas filed\n\nDaybell\u2019s team also prepared two subpoenas \u2013 one for Dave Channer, an attorney with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, requesting \u201Cany and all Church records including attendance records, temple records, disciplinary records, records of accomplishment, or any other records\u201D that pertain to Daybell.\u201D\n\nCarrie Reed of the Laurens Institute for Education was also served a subpoena for \u201Cany and all school records including attendance records, disciplinary records, records of accomplishment, or any other records in your possession or control that may pertain to Joshua Jaxon Vallow.\u201D\n\nThe next hearing in the case is scheduled for Feb. 9.

      "description": "#daybell #cameras #eastidahonews \n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 Family members of JJ Vallow, Tylee Ryan and Tammy Daybell are asking a judge to reconsider allowing cameras in the upcoming trial of Chad and Lori Daybell.\n\nThe Daybells have pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of JJ, Tylee and Tammy. Their trial, expected to last up to ten weeks, is scheduled to begin in Ada County on April 3.\n\nCameras were allowed in public hearings since Lori Daybell\u2019s arrest in February 2020 but last fall, her attorneys Jim Archibald and John Thomas filed a motion asking District Judge Steven Boyce to remove still and video cameras from the courtroom. Boyce granted the motion and said the ban applied to all future hearings including the trial.\n\n\u201CThis is unfair\u2026I have total respect for the judge. I admire him so far for how he\u2019s run his court but I think this was an ill-advised decision,\u201D Larry Woodcock, JJ Vallow\u2019s grandfather, tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CI can understand keeping the cameras out in pre-trial (hearings) but when that trial starts and those jurors are picked, it\u2019s time for the public and the families to be able to see that.\u201D\n\nJudges in Idaho have full discretion when it comes to audio and video coverage in their courtrooms. They can revoke cameras at any time and their decisions are not appealable.\n\nBoyce wrote in his September ruling that he found no misconduct from the media in hearings when cameras were allowed but expressed concerns about pre-trial publicity. That\u2019s one of the reasons he moved the trial to Ada County.\n\nFremont and Madison County residents, who are paying for a case that will likely end up costing millions, will be unable to view or listen to proceedings unless they go to Boise.\n\nTravel costs and the long duration of the trial are big concerns for family members of the victims who believe cameras could alleviate those problems.\n\n\u201CNot allowing cameras in the courtroom is an egregious disservice to family members who can\u2019t carve out two and a half months of their lives to attend the trial,\u201D Annie Cushing, Tylee\u2019s aunt, tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CWe deserve to be able to watch the legal system finally hold Lori and Chad\u2019s feet to the flames for their callous disregard for these victims\u2019 lives. I would respectfully ask Judge Boyce to please reconsider his decision on this matter.\u201D\n\nJohn Prior, Chad Daybell\u2019s attorney, is the one lawyer who supports cameras in the courtroom. He filed a motion in October asking Boyce to allow livestreaming of the trial but it was denied.\n\nProsecuting attorneys Rob Wood and Lindsey Blake have argued against cameras but Tammy Daybell\u2019s family says it\u2019s physically and financially unrealistic for Ron and Phyllis Douglas, Tammy\u2019s elderly parents, to leave their Springville, Utah home for several weeks and stay in Boise. The Douglases and Tammy\u2019s siblings have asked prosecutors for video access to the trial.\n\n\u201CProsecutors relayed the desire of the victims\u2019 families regarding their request for remote access to the proceedings to the court,\u201D Wood and Blake said in a statement to EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CWe believe the court will work to balance all parties\u2019 rights to fair trial and the neutrality and integrity of the jury process with the request of the victims\u2019 families for remote access to the proceedings.\u201D\n\nWith family members of JJ, Tylee and Tammy scattered across Louisiana, New York, Arizona, Utah, Idaho and other states, Woodcock hopes Boyce takes their concerns seriously.\n\n\u201CEverybody in southeast Idaho please, for God\u2019s sake, make your voices heard,\u201D Woodcock says. \u201CIf you have the ability to write the court, call the court, contact the court, please do. This is not difficult. This needs to be done. Everybody do what you can to support an effort to put cameras back in the court for the trial. Please do that for JJ and for Tylee and Tammy.\u201D\n\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#daybell #eastidahonews #court \n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 Larry and Kay Woodcock, the grandparents of JJ Vallow, are pleased with the outcome of a Thursday court hearing.\n\nJJ\u2019s mother, Lori Vallow Daybell, and her husband Chad Daybell are accused of killing the 7-year-old boy and his sister 16-year-old sister Tylee Ryan in 2019. Both Chad and Lori are charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of the children and Chad\u2019s previous wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\n\u201CI feel like the world is praying that this trial goes forward and that we have a good, honest, straight-up trial focused on the evidence,\u201D Larry Woodcock told EastIdahoNews.com Thursday afternoon. \u201CI believe this case is going to be proven beyond the shadow of a doubt. They can make all the excuses but in the end, they are guilty of murdering two children.\u201D\n\nAttorneys for Chad and Lori argued several motions Thursday morning. District Judge Steven Boyce denied a request from John Prior, Chad\u2019s attorney, to postpone the trial until April 2024. Boyce denied a motion from prosecutors to sequester the jury when the trial begins this spring and he denied a request from Lori\u2019s defense team to have Lori and Chad meet so they can strategize about the case.\n\n\u201CThank goodness he did deny that. It just seemed like an off-the-wall kind of request,\u201D Kay Woodcock said. \u201CI think Lori wanted to simply see Chad in person and maybe figure out if she\u2019s going to turn on him. There has to be more to do it than just them wanting to meet and strategize.\u201D\n\nThe Woodcocks believe Chad\u2019s defense involves turning against Lori. As far as EastIdahoNews.com could tell, he never looked at his wife during the two-and-a-half-hour court hearing Thursday but Lori was seen glancing Chad\u2019s direction several times.\n\n\u201CLori \u2013 you\u2019re fixing to be thrown totally under the bus,\u201D Larry Woodcock said. \u201CIn fact, you\u2019re not going to get thrown under a bus \u2013 you\u2019re going got get thrown under a steamroller. Chad is not your friend, his attorney is not your friend and I truly believe they are going to throw her under the bus the moment the case opens.\u201D\n\nWatch our entire conversation with Larry and Kay Woodcock in the video player above.",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #court \n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 Prosecutors plan to present \u201Csufficient evidence\u201D that shows Lori Vallow Daybell intended her two children and Tammy Daybell to die and that she participated in the killings of her kids.\n\nThat\u2019s according to court documents filed Thursday from Madison County Prosecuting Attorney Rob Wood and Fremont County Prosecuting Attorney Lindsey Blake.\n\nThe prosecutors also expressed \u201Cserious reservations\u201D about Daybell\u2019s request to meet with her husband Chad, and they argue her alleged actions make her eligible for the death penalty.\n\nLori and Chad Daybell are charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2013 two of Lori\u2019s children \u2013 along with Chad\u2019s previous wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\nProsecutors are seeking the death penalty against the Daybells, but Lori\u2019s attorneys filed a motion this month arguing Blake and Wood have not been specific enough in stating why their client is eligible for death.\n\nDefense attorney Jim Archibald asked District Judge Steven Boyce to declare the death penalty unconstitutional in the case and take it off the table.\n\nIn the newly filed objection to Archibald\u2019s motion, prosecutors explained why they believe Daybell qualifies for the death penalty.\n\n\u201CSufficient evidence existed for the grand jury to find probable cause that the defendant intended for her children and Tammy Daybell to die. Further, there is sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that the defendant participated in the killing of her own children,\u201D Blake wrote.\n\nBlake calls the facts in the case \u201Cegregious and heinous.\u201D\n\n\u201CThe evidence the state will introduce at trial, some of which a grand jury has already reviewed, will establish that the defendant intended for her children and her boyfriend\u2019s wife to die, and that she affirmatively acted to make those deaths happen.\u201D\n\nLori\u2019s attorneys filed a notice of alibi this month, saying her children died in the apartment of her brother, Alex Cox, while she was in her own apartment and that she was in Hawaii when Tammy Daybell died.\n\nIn a separate court filing, prosecutors responded to Lori\u2019s request to meet with Chad in person and talk with him on the phone for \u201Cstrategy sessions\u201D ahead of their trial.\n\nArchibald said he and co-counsel John Thomas will attend the meetings and phone conversations, along with John Prior, Chad\u2019s attorney, and the conversations will not be recorded or used as evidence.\n\n\u201CThe state has serious reservations about allowing the co-defendants to have face-to-face, or other communication directly with each other,\u201D Wood wrote. \u201CThe state recognizes that the defendants have agreed to not use any evidence or information they may obtain through any discussions or meetings against each other; nevertheless, the state is not willing to make a similar agreement.\n\n\u201CAny communications between each individual defendant and his/her attorney(s) are confidential; however, having the other defendant and/or his/her counsel present would make them potential witnesses of statements made by the other defendant and eliminate any claim to attorney/client privilege,\u201D Wood continues.\n\nWhile not completely objecting to the idea of the Daybells meeting, Wood asks Boyce to consider objections raised by prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors acknowledge in another court filing that hair samples recently discovered by the Idaho State Lab may be used to determine if there is sufficient DNA to create a DNA profile.\n\nBased on court documents filed in July, it\u2019s likely the hair came from duct tape inside a body bag used to transport JJ\u2019s remains, but the new filings do not provide specifics.\n\nThe hair may be destroyed while the lab is testing for DNA, prosecutors wrote.\n\n\u201CIn the event sufficient DNA is available to create more than one profile, the DNA sample will be split between the parties for testing, and each party may have the expert of their choice test their respective portions of the DNA,\u201D prosecutors said. \u201CIn the event sufficient DNA is available for only one profile to be created, the parties agree the State Lab shall halt any further testing and the parties will reconvene at that time to determine who should conduct any further testing.\u201D\n\nLegal counsel for both Chad and Lori filed separate motions objecting to having the jury sequestered when the trial begins in the spring.\n\nRead the rest of the story here: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2023/01/lori-daybell-intended-for-children-to-die-and-participated-in-their-killings-prosecutors-say-in-newly-filed-documents/",

ANTHONY \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell says her children died in her brother\u2019s apartment, she wants to meet with her husband for \u201Cstrategy sessions\u201D and she believes she does not qualify for the death penalty.\n\nThat\u2019s according to several new motions filed by her attorneys within the past week.\n\nDaybell and her husband Chad Daybell are charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2013 two of Lori\u2019s children \u2013 along with Chad\u2019s previous wife, Tammy Daybell. If found guilty, they could face the death penalty.\n\nThe couple is scheduled to be tried together this spring. Before it begins, Lori wants permission from District Judge Steven Boyce to communicate with Chad.\n\n\u201CWith settlement proposals, mediation, motions and trial fast approaching, Lori and Chad would like to be able to talk together in person and on the phone about their options,\u201D Jim Archibald, Lori\u2019s attorney, wrote in a motion.\n\nThe couple was married in Hawaii on Nov. 5, 2019, and Lori was arrested the following February. Archibald noted she spoke with Chad on multiple recorded jail phone calls until he was arrested on June 9, 2020.\n\nSince then, they have only talked to each other one time, according to Archibald. It was on an arranged call in July 2022 between Chad, Lori and their attorneys.\n\n\u201CThe call was approved by the prosecuting attorney and sheriff and was not recorded,\u201D Archibald said.\n\nIf Boyce approves the motion, Archibald says he and co-counsel John Thomas will attend in-person meetings and phone conversations, along with John Prior, Chad\u2019s attorney.\n\n\u201CThe attorneys \u2026 will not record the conversations and will not use the conversations as evidence. The conversations can be deemed as for settlement purposes only,\u201D Archibald wrote.\n\nNotice of alibi and constitutionality of death penalty\n\nIn a separate two-paragraph notice of alibi, Archibald says Lori was not present when her children and Tammy Daybell died. Police say JJ and Tylee were killed in September 2019. Their remains were found buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s property.\n\nChad\u2019s wife Tammy Daybell died on Oct. 19, 2019.\n\n\u201CLori Vallow was in her own apartment in Rexburg, Idaho, when JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan died in the apartment of (her brother) Alex Cox in Rexburg, Idaho. Defendant was with Melanie Gibb, David Warwick, and/or Chad Daybell,\u201D Archibald wrote. \u201CLori Vallow was in Hawaii when Tammy Daybell died at the home of Chad Daybell in Salem, Idaho. Defendant was with Melani Boudreaux and/or Audrey Barattiero.\u201D\n\nCox lived in the same complex as Lori when the children died. He died in December 2019, and the medical examiner gave his cause of death as blood clots.\n\nRELATED | Who\u2019s who in the Daybell case\n\nRELATED | What Alex Cox revealed days before he died and the unusual massage he gave his wife\n\nIn two separate filings (here and here) addressing the death penalty, Archibald argued prosecutors have not been specific enough in stating why Daybell is eligible for the death penalty. He asks Boyce to declare the death penalty unconstitutional and take it off the table.\n\nChad Daybell motion to continue\n\nJohn Prior, Chad Daybell\u2019s attorney, also filed an 18-page motion asking Boyce to reschedule the trial for April 2024.\n\nPrior said he still needs a substantial amount of time to prepare for the trial and is awaiting further evidence from prosecutors. The deadline for prosecutors to turn over all discovery materials is Feb. 23.\n\n\u201C(That date) is less than 40 days before a complex, capital trial is set to begin,\u201D Prior wrote. \u201CThe (current) timeline does not permit a review of all evidence, consultation with appropriate experts, independent examinations, and consideration of potential legal claims and challenges.\u201D\n\nWhat\u2019s next\n\nThe motions will be heard in front of Boyce on Jan. 19 in Fremont County along with a motion from prosecutors to sequester the jury.

      "description": "#daybell #eastidahonews #court \n\nST. ANTHONY \u2013 After being found competent for trial, Lori Vallow Daybell was back in court Thursday together for the first time with her husband Chad Daybell to discuss multiple motions, including setting a new trial date.\n\nDistrict Judge Steven Boyce heard arguments from both Daybells\u2019 lawyers and the prosecution before deciding that the 10-week trial would begin on April 3, 2023, after being postponed from January 2023.\n\nThe Daybells have pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2013 two of Lori\u2019s kids \u2013 along with Chad\u2019s previous wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\nLori wore a gray blouse and black dress pants with heels, hair perfectly curled, as she smiled while walking into the courtroom.\n\nChad appeared after his wife. He wore a white button-up shirt and gray slacks.\n\nHe looked emotionless and stared blankly ahead throughout the hearing. Neither of the Daybells so much as glanced in each other\u2019s direction, even as Chad left the courtroom after the trial date was set.\n\nJohn Prior, Chad\u2019s lawyer, told the court that he received a thumb drive that morning with more than 115 items of discovery on it from Madison Prosecuting Attorney Rob Wood. Prior said the trial date needed to be no earlier than October 2023, if not sometime in 2024, to give him time to review these new findings.\n\n\u201CSome of these items of discovery address significant items, and it is going to take a significant amount of time for not only myself but my investigative team to go over all of it,\u201D said Prior. \u201CI\u2019m creeping up on two years of this thing, and it blows my mind that after two years, I can\u2019t get the simplest items of discovery on this case. You\u2019d think that would be a priority.\u201D\n\nOne of Lori\u2019s lawyers, Jim Archibald, argued that since she hadn\u2019t waived her right to a speedy trial, the court needed to set a date as soon as February 2023.\n\n\u201CFor purposes of trial, my client has not waived her speedy trial. By our calculation, we cannot agree to anything past Feb. 21, 2023,\u201D said Archibald. \u201CThe court needs to set our client\u2019s jury trial for that time. If it\u2019s after, then we believe her speedy trial rights have been violated, and we will file a motion to dismiss the case.\u201D\n\nBoyce explained his ruling by stating that Lori had been in jail for almost two and a half years and, as Archibald mentioned, had not waived her right to a speedy trial.\n\n\u201CBy my calculations, I have Ms. Vallow, who has been in custody two years and 10 days since her initial arrest. Mr. Daybell has waived his right to a speedy trial and has been in jail 912 and a half days by my calculation,\u201D said Boyce. \u201CThe length of incarceration is of great concern to me. I have a defendant who has never waived her right to a speedy trial.\u201D\n\nThe court also heard arguments for a motion to compel after John Thomas, another lawyer for Lori, argued that the prosecution was not disclosing all of the details about meetings with witnesses, particularly Zulema Pastenes, the wife of Lori\u2019s late brother Alex Cox.\n\nThomas called Brandon Hobbs to the stand, an investigator from Arizona who met with Pastenes. He testified that Pastenes told him she had met with the prosecution, something that hadn\u2019t been disclosed to the court previously.\n\nBased on the argument, Boyce granted the motion to compel, stating that \u201Cfurther compliance is necessary\u201D from the state.\n\nThe last motion heard was the motion for a bill of particulars, a very technical proceeding, arguing that the court must issue a written document which explains the allegations against Daybell and Vallow Daybell in more detail.\n\nBoyce ruled to take the motion under advisement and will release a written ruling in the coming weeks.\n\nOther motions that were scheduled to be discussed included a motion to prevent the death qualification of the jury and a motion to declare the death penalty unconstitutional in this case, both of which were rescheduled.\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #court \n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 Chad Daybell\u2019s defense will be \u201Cdiametrically\u201D different from his wife\u2019s, and their trials should be held separately, his attorney says.\n\nChad and Lori Vallow Daybell are charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2013 two of Lori\u2019s kids \u2013 along with Chad\u2019s previous wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\nTheir death penalty cases are conjoined, but during a hearing with District Judge Steven Boyce at the Fremont County Courthouse on Thursday morning, John Prior, Chad\u2019s attorney, argued they need to be severed.\n\n\u201COur version of the facts of this case will differ greatly from what Ms. Vallow and her legal counsel are going to be presenting,\u201D Prior said. \u201COur defense is diametrically different than Ms. Vallow\u2019s, and the cases need to be separated.\u201D\n\nWearing a white shirt and dark red tie, Chad sat silently next to Prior for the hour-long hearing. Boyce did not allow cameras in the courtroom. A few members of the public and several Rexburg Police and Fremont County Sheriff detectives observed proceedings.\n\nThe hearing was scheduled after Prior filed a lengthy motion to sever in September.\n\n\u201CThere is a significant amount of information in this case, and the result could be the defendant is put to death. Given the severity of consequences, the courts and federal courts have made it a habit to sever capital cases,\u201D Prior argued.\n\nPrior mentioned that Chad has waived his right to a speedy trial while Lori has not. Her case is on hold until her mental competency can be determined. A hearing was held on that issue Wednesday afternoon, but it\u2019s unknown what occurred as proceedings were sealed.\n\nLori also faces a conspiracy to commit murder charge in Arizona for the death of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow. Prior says he plans to use information from that case during his defense arguments for Chad.\n\n\u201CThere was a documentary done by Netflix that portrayed this case in a way I don\u2019t necessarily agree with. \u2026 They talked about the allegations of what Ms. Vallow was allegedly involved in down in Arizona,\u201D Prior said. \u201CI am going to be petitioning the court to allow me to use a certain amount of information as it relates to Arizona.\u201D\n\nPrior also mentioned a concern about gender stereotyping and referenced to evidence that shows when it comes to capital cases, juries sentence men to death more often than women.\n\nFremont County Prosecuting Attorney Lindsey Blake argued against the motion for severance and said Prior had not met the \u201Cheavy burden\u201D defendants bear to have a judge sever a case.\n\n\u201CSeverance is last-ditch effort. It\u2019s meant to be used when no other remedy is available,\u201D Blake said.\n\nBlake argued joint trials are preferred for multiple reasons including minimalizing the risk of inconsistent verdicts, efficiently using court, government and witness resources, and they can prevent gamesmanship.\n\nShe said the evidence and witnesses in the Daybell cases are similar \u201Cif not identical,\u201D and it only makes sense to keep them together.\n\n\u201CThis is set to be a 10-week trial. We are talking about a severance that would result in a total of 20-week trials between the two,\u201D Blake said.\n\nBlake suggested one solution to potential problems could be having two juries in session during the joint trial \u2013 one for Lori and one for Chad. If witness or evidence issues were raised that did not apply to one defendant, that particular jury could leave the courtroom.\n\nBoyce asked if there had been confessions to the crimes from either Chad or Lori. Blake and Prior both said they were unaware of any.\n\nThe judge said he will consider the motion to sever and issue a written order at a later date. Both Chad and Lori have pleaded not guilty to all charges. A trial date has not been set.\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #trial \n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 A judge has suspended all matters in the Lori Vallow Daybell murder case until her mental competency can be determined.\n\nIn an order issued Thursday afternoon, District Judge Steven Boyce responded to a motion from Daybell\u2019s attorneys asking for court proceedings be paused. Prosecutors submitted a response under seal Wednesday and a closed hearing was held that afternoon \u201Con shortened time\u201D to discuss the motion.\n\n\u201CDue to legal issues raised by counsel in their motions and during the hearing\u2026(this case) is hereby suspended until a determination of Mrs. Daybell\u2019s competency to stand trial can be determined,\u201D Boyce wrote. \u201CAs a result of a need to determine Mrs. Daybell\u2019s competency\u2026the court sees no other alternative at this time than to vacate the January 9, 2023 trial.\u201D\n\nDaybell and her husband Chad Daybell have pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2013 two of Lori\u2019s kids \u2013 along with Chad\u2019s previous wife, Tammy Daybell. The Daybell\u2019s joint trial was scheduled to begin in January.\n\nThe Wednesday hearing was closed to the public so it\u2019s unknown what was discussed, but Daybell\u2019s attorneys have raised concerns about their client in the past. Jim Archibald, one of her lawyers, called her mental health \u201Cextremely complex and fragile\u201D in court documents filed five months ago and noted she has the potential to be hospitalized again.\n\nHer case was previously paused after she was declared incompetent for trial and committed to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare in June 2021. Ten months later, she was deemed competent and proceedings resumed.\n\nChad Daybell\u2019s motions\n\nLori Vallow Daybell was expected to appear at a hearing in Fremont County on Oct. 13 but will no longer attend. Chad will be there with his attorney, John Prior, to argue several motions.\n\nPrior wants Chad\u2019s case severed from his wife\u2019s and is asking the judge to postpone the trial until late 2023. It\u2019s unclear how the pause in Lori\u2019s case affects Chad\u2019s.\n\nIn other motions filed Thursday, Prosecuting Attorneys Lindsey Blake and Rob Wood opposed a request from Prior to allow Chad to wear street clothes to hearings. Prosecutors raised no objection to Lori wearing street clothes during a hearing last month, but at the time, cameras were allowed in court. Boyce has since issued a camera ban.\n\n\u201CGiven the new posture of these proceedings in relation to the media\u2019s access to images of the defendants, the state\u2019s concern regarding jury contamination has been dispelled, and the state would request\u2026the defendants no longer be allowed to appear in street clothes,\u201D Blake wrote.\n\nProsecutors also objected to Prior\u2019s motion to allow cameras in Chad\u2019s trial, stating Boyce has already ruled and reopening the argument \u201Cis a waste of court time and resources.\u201D\n\nA response was also filed in regards to a motion from Prior requesting transcripts from grand jury proceedings that took place in December \u201Cin which witnesses were brought in and testified regarding facts of this case.\u201D\n\nProsecutors wrote that Chad does not have any additional charges from any other grand jury proceedings but acknowledged a grand jury was convened in December \u201Cunder a separate case number, and the filings and proceedings are not public.\u201D\n\nIt\u2019s unknown who the other grand jury case involves, but no additional charges have been filed against Lori Vallow Daybell since she was indicted in May 2021.\n\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #trial \n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s defense team is asking a judge to pause court proceedings in her case and postpone her trial.\n\nIn a motion filed Monday, Jim Archibald and John Thomas, Daybell\u2019s defense attorneys, requested District Judge Steven Boyce continue the trial and toll time limits in the case. Tolling time limits essentially pauses deadlines required by the court to file certain motions.\n\nDaybell and her husband Chad Daybell have pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2013 two of Lori\u2019s kids \u2013 along with Chad\u2019s previous wife, Tammy Daybell. The Daybells joint trial is scheduled to begin in January.\n\nA large portion of the two-page motion is redacted but Archibald hints the reason for the continuance request is related to Daybell\u2019s mental health.\n\n\u201CThe time limit to file written notice of our intention to raise any issue of mental condition under Idaho Code Title 18 is 90 days before trial,\u201D he wrote.\n\nDaybell\u2019s case was previously paused after she was declared incompetent for trial and committed to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare in June 2021. Ten months later, she was deemed competent and proceedings resumed.\n\nStill, Archibald called Daybell\u2019s mental health \u201Cextremely complex and fragile\u201D in court documents filed five months ago and noted she has the potential to be hospitalized again.\n\n\u201CNone of the experts employed by the Court and the State of Idaho Department of Health and Welfare claim she is malingering or making up her mental illness. She understands that she will undergo further mental health testing, as a neuropsychologist approved for the defense team will be meeting with her,\u201D Archibald wrote.\n\nIn a separate court filing Monday, Idaho Deputy Attorney Amy Long responded on behalf of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to a request from an author to have sealed court documents in the Daybell cases unsealed.\n\nLong wrote the IDHW does not intend to take a position or participate in the proceedings.\n\n\u201CThe Department\u2019s interest in this matter is solely in protecting confidential information of the participants in the information requested and the Department will raise no objection to the Court reviewing and redacting any such information that the Court may deem confidential,\u201D Long wrote.\n\nThe newest filings come a week after John Prior, Chad Daybell\u2019s attorney, filed motions to sever Chad\u2019s case from his wife\u2019s and postpone the trial until late 2023.\n\nA hearing on the motions is scheduled for Oct. 13 in Fremont County.\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #trial \n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 Chad Daybell wants his trial postponed until at least next fall and he\u2019s asking for it to be held separate from his wife\u2019s.\n\nHe and Lori Vallow Daybell have pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2013 two of Lori\u2019s kids \u2013 along with Chad\u2019s previous wife, Tammy Daybell. Their death penalty cases are currently conjoined and a trial is scheduled to begin on Jan. 9, 2023 in Ada County.\n\nIn lengthy motions filed Tuesday, John Prior, Chad Daybell\u2019s attorney, argued his trial should be continued due to a \u201Csubstantial amount of investigation and preparation\u201D along with a \u201Csignificant amount\u201D of evidence he says he has not received from prosecutors.\n\n\u201CThere is no possible way to complete the investigation and be prepared for a death penalty trial in January 2023,\u201D Prior wrote in his motion. \u201CDeath penalty cases are unique in the criminal legal system and require counsel to undertake an extensive, time-consuming investigation.\u201D\n\nPrior argues that because this is a capital murder case, he must prepare for essentially two trials: the merits phase and, should there be a conviction, the sentencing phase. The attorney noted his time has been focused on the \u201Ccomplex\u201D merit phase and he is just now starting the initial stages of the sentencing phase.\n\n\u201CPushing this case to trial prematurely will heighten the already very significant risk of reversal that is characteristic of death penalty cases,\u201D Prior wrote, noting death penalty cases and appeals cost taxpayers millions of dollars. \u201CIn order to conserve resources, as well as preserve Mr. Daybell\u2019s constitutional rights and the integrity of these capital proceedings, Mr. Daybell respectfully requests this court vacate the current trial date.\u201D\n\nDaybell is asking for his trial to begin no earlier than October 2023. During a hearing in December, prosecutors said they expect the trial to take up to ten weeks and asked for it to start next September. Prior asked for the trial to begin this October and Judge Steven Boyce ended up setting the start date for January 2023.\n\nIn a motion to sever, Prior argued that having Daybell tried with Lori would deprive his client of his constitutional right to present a complete defense. Prior said he plans to introduce \u201Cprior bad acts of both Ms. Vallow and Alex Cox (Lori\u2019s deceased brother), as well as evidence regarding their relationship and the death of Mr. Cox.\u201D\n\nPrior noted that Daybell is requesting a delay in the trial start date, but Lori has not waived her right to a speedy trial ane because of that, the cases should be separated.\n\n\u201CWhile the court may continue Ms. Vallow\u2019s trial date despite her asserted speedy trial right, severance is the most direct approach to enforce the constitutional rights of both Mr. Daybell and Mrs. Vallow, and the most sensible approach due to the irreconcilable conflicts which will arise in a joint trial of both death-noticed co-defendants,\u201D Prior wrote.\n\nBoyce combined the trials for the husband and wife in October 2020. Prior previously filed a motion to sever in September 2021 but Boyce denied it earlier this year.\n\nPrior asked Boyce to hear his motion to sever on Oct. 13 in Fremont County. He requested a hearing in January to set a new trial date.\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "title": "Judge Boyce bans cameras from upcoming Daybell hearings",
      "description": "#EastIdahoNews #Daybell #media \n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 District Judge Steven Boyce has issued an order banning video and still cameras from all upcoming hearings in the Chad and Lori Vallow Daybell case.\n\nThe order came in response to a motion from Jim Archibald and John Thomas, Lori Daybell\u2019s defense attorneys, asking that cameras be removed from future proceedings. They said they were upset that cameras operated by Court TV during an Aug. 16 hearing were focused mainly on their client, and microphones had been placed on the defendant\u2019s and prosecution\u2019s tables.\n\nProsecutors Rob Wood and Lindsey Blake filed a motion supporting the camera ban while EastIdahoNews.com joined 32 other local, state and national media outlets in opposition.\n\nJudges in Idaho have the right to limit cameras in their courtrooms, and Boyce heard arguments from all sides last week before issuing his seven-page response Friday afternoon.\n\n\u201CWhile the right to public access must be protected, the scope of the coverage cannot supersede the rights of all parties to the fair administration of justice in this case,\u201D Boyce wrote. \u201CThe court has previously been made aware and continues to be informed that documentaries, dramatizations and fictionalized media focusing on the defendants and allegations in this case have already been procured and continue to be disseminated to the public.\u201D\n\nChad and Lori Daybell are facing multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2013 two of Lori Daybell\u2019s kids \u2013 along with Chad\u2019s previous wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\nBoyce wrote he found no misconduct or interruptions from the media during previous hearings and said journalists in the courtroom have been professional and respectful. But the judge is worried about pre-trial publicity and noted \u201Cvisual\u201D coverage of the case could impede the ability to pick a fair jury.\n\n\u201CThis court has previously permitted cameras in the courtroom during this case, allowing both photography and video transmission, \u2018but when the case is a \u201Csensational\u201D one, tensions develop between the right of the accused to trial by an impartial jury and the right guaranteed others by the First Amendment,\u0027\u201D Boyce wrote, referencing Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart.\n\nThe media argued citizens of Fremont and Madison counties, who are paying for the case, have a right to view proceedings \u2013 especially when the 10-week trial begins in Ada County next January. Boyce noted the issue and said he intends to provide \u201Cenhanced access\u201D with designated seating in the courtroom for Madison and Fremont County residents.\n\nZac Gershberg, associate professor of journalism and media studies at Idaho State University, told EastIdahoNews.com Friday afternoon that traveling four hours to Ada County to view trial proceedings creates a burden for Madison and Fremont residents.\n\n\u201CWhile (Boyce) is certainly authorized by Idaho law to make this ruling, I.C.A.R. 45, which he draws from, would allow the court to proceed with visual access for the public until he determines such coverage is indeed \u2018interfering in any way with the proper administration of justice.\u2019 He is only presuming down the road that it might,\u201D Gershberg said. \u201CIt is also rather curious for Judge Boyce to quote from Nebraska v. Stuart, a case in which the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of press rights over the decision of a trial judge, finding \u2018that pretrial publicity \u2014 even pervasive, adverse publicity \u2014 does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.\u0027\u201D\n\nLarry and Kay Woodcock, the grandparents of JJ Vallow, are \u201Cdisappointed and distraught\u201D following Boyce\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201CAlthough we want justice for JJ, Tylee, Charles and Tammy, we feel he overreacted. The simple solution is not to televise preliminary hearings in order to not taint a jury pool, yet still allow cameras during the trial,\u201D the Woodcocks said in a statement to EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CSome of our immediate family, close friends and supporters from around the globe will not be able to share in this most horrific story. This story speaks from beyond the graves. We want the world to hear the atrocities executed by Lori and Chad Daybell.\u201D\n\nAlthough Boyce revoked video and photographic coverage, he wrote audio proceedings will continue to be permitted using in-courtroom microphones. It\u2019s unclear if a live audio feed for public dissemination will be allowed.\n\nAny decision by judges regarding audio and video coverage can not be appealed, according to Idaho Court Administrative Rule 45.",

Let us do what is right.\u201D\n\nWoodcock\u2019s 7-year-old grandson Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and his sister, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan, were discovered buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s Salem property in June 2020. Daybell is married to the children\u2019s mother, Lori Vallow Daybell. Chad and Lori face multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of the kids and Chad\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\nAfter JJ and Tylee\u2019s remains were found, they were taken to the Ada County Coroner\u2019s Office for an autopsy. Tylee\u2019s body was dismembered and burned, according to court documents, while JJ\u2019s body was wrapped in tight black plastic and secured with gray duct tape. Authorities have not released a cause of death for either child.\n\nThe bodies have since been brought back to eastern Idaho but Woodcock is upset they have not been released to family members for burial or memorial services.\n\n\u201CI don\u2019t care about Lori. I don\u2019t care about Chad. Did what they do is right? No. It was wrong. It was horrible. I don\u2019t even know how you comprehend doing something like that but at this point, I just don\u2019t care. Let us have the kids. Let us bury them. Let us do the right thing and that\u2019s all I\u2019m begging the court,\u201D Woodcock said.\n\nCourt proceedings have been underway since JJ and Tylee were found and their bodies are considered evidence, according to attorney David Leroy. He has practiced law for five decades and served as Idaho Attorney General, the Ada County Prosecuting Attorney and Lt. Governor of Idaho.\n\n\u201CCertainly these bodies are the most significant of evidence in this set of cases (and) the best practice is to retain all of the evidence until all of the appeals and all of the appeals of the appeals have been completed,\u201D LeRoy tells EastIdahoNews.com.\n\nWATCH OUR ENTIRE CONVERSATION WITH DAVID LEROY IN THE VIDEO PLAYER ABOVE\n\nWhile prosecutors have completed autopsies on JJ and Tylee, defense attorneys have the right to have their own autopsies performed. Both sides can request DNA and other testing on the bodies, such as when prosecutors in July asked Judge Steven Boyce to allow them to collect comprehensive DNA from underneath JJ\u2019s fingernails.\n\nHaving the bodies in custody for testing from the defense and prosecution helps maintain evidence and the integrity of the case, LeRoy says.\n\n\u201CWe do not know, as the trial looms, what kind of testimony there will be about scientific testing, the respective cause of death of these two children (and) who might have done what \u2026 to cause these deaths,\u201D LeRoy explains.\n\nIf prosecutors and defense attorneys agree, it\u2019s possible the bodies could be released before the trials conclude. The Woodcocks have previously said they want to have public memorial services for the children in Idaho, Arizona and their home state of Louisiana.\n\nThe trial for Chad and Lori, who have pleaded not guilty to all charges, is scheduled to begin Jan. 9 in Ada County. It\u2019s expected to last up to ten weeks and LeRoy says there has never been another case like this in Idaho history.\n\n\u201CThis horrendous set of allegations, the interrelationship of multiple death allegations, the overlay of religion and extreme views that are not related to any conventional religious view \u2013 this is utterly unique,\u201D he says.\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#EastIdahoNews #daybell #sinsofourmother\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This story and interview were completed before Colby Ryan was arrested and charged with sexual assault.\n\nIDAHO FALLS \u2014 A three-part series examining the Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell murder case is set to be released on Netflix this month.\n\n\u201CSins of Our Mother\u201D explores how Lori Daybell \u201Cspiraled downward into religious fanaticism and paranoia to find herself and her fifth husband standing trial for murder,\u201D according to Netflix.\n\nThe story is told through the eyes of Colby Ryan, Lori\u2019s oldest son, and a trailer for the documentary series begins with a tense phone call between the two. Daybell is in jail and asked Ryan how he\u2019s doing. He replies, \u201CI\u2019m not good, Mom.\u201D\n\nHome videos of the family in happier times are shown, and Ryan opens up about his mother facing murder charges for the death of his siblings, Tylee Ryan and JJ Vallow. A grand jury in Arizona also charged her with conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in connection to the death of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow.\n\n\u201CColby has been dealing with the loss of his mother, the loss of his brother and sister, the loss of Charles, who he considers his father \u2013 how do you do that? How do you put one foot in front of the other? How do you reconcile yourself with that?\u201D Skye Borgman, the director of the documentary, tells EastIdahoNews.com.\n\nBorgman has been working on the project for over two years. She\u2019s directed \u201CAbducted in Plain Sight,\u201D \u201CGirl in the Picture\u201D and other true-crime documentaries but says \u201CSins of Our Mother\u201D is different.\n\nRELATED | \u2018Abducted in Plain Sight\u2019 filmmaker opens up about Pocatello-based documentary\n\n\u201CThere\u2019s a lot of information I feel we don\u2019t have, and that\u2019s not always the case with other stories I\u2019ve done,\u201D Borgman explains. \u201CThis is still a story in motion. I don\u2019t even know if once the trial is concluded that this story will be concluded.\u201D\n\nBorgman says one of the goals of the docuseries was to get past the tabloids \u201Cblasting cult mom type headlines\u201D and explore how the events have affected Ryan and others, like Barry and Janis Cox \u2013 Lori\u2019s parents and Ryan\u2019s grandparents \u2013 who also appear in the series.\n\n\u201CSins of Our Mother\u201D was nearly finished and ready for release last year, but police in Arizona released a large file of text messages, photos, video interviews and other details made public for the first time. Borgman met with Netflix, and the decision was made to re-work the series.\n\n\u201CAt that point we said we have to get this in. There was so much more information there that really gave a lot more insight and specifics to, I think, Lori\u2019s decline, the methodology behind it and to the actual messages that were going on back and forth,\u201D Borgman says.\n\nBorgman says she learned a lot about Lori Daybell working on the project but still doesn\u2019t understand her and isn\u2019t sure if anyone ever will.\n\n\u201CI still have a really hard time understanding how she could have gotten so extreme in her beliefs to have killed or at least had a hand in killing her children,\u201D Borgman says.\n\nWatch our entire interview with Borgman in the video player above.\n\n\u2018Sins of Our Mother\u2019 is set to be released on Sept. 14.\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#EastIdahoNews #Daybell #Vallow\n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s attorneys want cameras banned from upcoming court hearings, claiming the media has \u201Cabused\u201D their privilege to photograph and video proceedings.\n\nIn a motion filed Tuesday, Jim Archibald and John Thomas reference Daybell\u2019s Aug. 16 hearing. Court TV acted as a pool camera and provided a video feed for media outlets across the country.\n\nA remote video camera was set up in the jury box with another remote video camera installed in front of the defense\u2019s table. EastIdahoNews.com had a still photographer taking pictures from the jury box.\n\nJudge Steven Boyce approved the camera requests, and media outlets in the courtroom followed rules set out in an April 14 order governing courtroom conduct.\n\n\u201CUnbeknownst to defense counsel, Court TV and/or another media outlet set up a remote camera a few feet in front of the defendant\u2019s desk, and put microphones on the defendant\u2019s desk,\u201D the defense\u2019s motion says. \u201CThe cameras zoomed in repeatedly on the defendant while she was listening to the arguments of counsel and while she was trying to convene with counsel.\u201D\n\nThe defense argues that the zoom on Daybell\u2019s face \u201Cwas so close that the obvious intent of the filming was not to listen to the arguments of counsel, but to gauge every facial expression of the defendant or her lawyers.\u201D\n\nDaybell\u2019s attorneys say they are unsure if conversations between them and their client were recorded and write that if notes had been written between them, the camera could have zoomed in \u2013 violating attorney-client privilege.\n\nA review of video from the hearing shows no confidential conversations were broadcast, and the camera never zoomed in on notes on the defense\u2019s table.\n\n\u201CThe court has the discretion to limit media activity, which only serves to sensationalize the proceedings and which converts the courtroom into a circus,\u201D the motion says. \u201CDefense counsel would ask that since media has abused their privilege to photograph and record the proceedings in a fair and reasonable manner, that cameras be banned from the courtroom. Alternatively, still camera photos (with no zoom features) from the jury box or from the front row of the spectator section may be acceptable.\u201D\n\nArchibald and Thomas ask Boyce to hold a hearing to discuss their request.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a motion has been filed asking that cameras be banned from the courtroom in this case. In July 2020, Madison County Prosecuting Attorney Rob Wood asked Judge Farren Eddens to prohibit video cameras during preliminary hearings.\n\nEastIdahoNews.com joined other media outlets in opposing the ban and hired Idaho Falls attorney Steve Wright.\n\n\u201CWhen the public is aware that the law is being enforced and the criminal justice system is functioning, an outlet is provided for these understandable reactions and emotions,\u201D Wright wrote in an objection at the time. \u201CThe unique and remarkable allegations of this case are the very reason that video coverage of the proceedings is vital.\u201D\n\nEddens denied Wood\u2019s motion, and cameras were allowed into proceedings.\n\nA hearing on Daybell\u2019s new motion had not been scheduled as of Wednesday afternoon.",

      "description": "#EastIdahoNews #Daybell\n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 A judge will decide whether a grand jury needs to reconvene and clarify language in the criminal indictment against Lori Vallow Daybell.\n\nDuring an hour-long hearing Tuesday, Daybell smiled, laughed and appeared relaxed wearing a gray shirt and black dress pants as her defense team argued the wording in two counts of the indictment is confusing and could lead to problems.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ve been practicing law for 20 years and this particular charge baffled me,\u201D defense attorney John Thomas said. \u201CWe don\u2019t want to do this again and have an appeals court say they couldn\u2019t make heads or tails on what\u2019s going on with this.\u201D\n\nDaybell\u2019s defense team said two of the counts listed in the indictment are complicated because they each include two separate allegations \u2013 conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and grand theft by deception.\n\nHer attorneys asked District Judge Steven Boyce to reconvene a grand jury to deliberate and amend the indictment so the alleged crimes are separated.\n\n\u201CThe conspiracy to commit murder and the conspiracy to commit grand theft are two separate conspiracies,\u201D Thomas said. \u201CWe believe it would be confusing to a jury to be able to figure out what elements were met, when the elements were met and to what extent the elements were met.\u201D\n\nProsecuting attorney Rob Wood argued against reconvening a grand jury and said the two charges are connected.\n\n\u201CThe state fundamentally disagrees that it will be confusing to a jury,\u201D Wood said. \u201CWe believe the charges are linked and aren\u2019t completely separate. We believe the jury will find that they (Chad and Lori Daybell) agreed to commit those two crimes.\u201D\n\nWood said the grand jury was not confused when it issued the indictment in May 2021 and doesn\u2019t believe having the two charges on one count is an issue.\n\n\u201CThese are charges based on evidence provided to the grand jury. They didn\u2019t have a problem with it so if they found it, we can put it in front of the trial jury,\u201D Wood argued.\n\nJudge Steven Boyce did not make a decision during the hearing but said he will issue a written order. A sealed hearing regarding other matters was then held out of public view.\n\nAs Daybell left the courthouse, she smiled and did not respond to questions from EastIdahoNews.com on whether she missed her children or had anything to say.\n\nChad Daybell and his attorney, John Prior, did not attend the hearing. They, along with Lori\u2019s attorneys, were originally set to discuss a motion about DNA testing but an agreement was reached with prosecutors late last week on how to proceed.\n\nChad and Lori are facing multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2014 two of Lori\u2019s kids \u2014 and Chad\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell.

Morgan currently teaches forensic science at Jacksonville State University in Alabama and hosts the podcast Body Bags.\n\nLast week, prosecutors in the Daybell cases asked a judge to allow consumptive DNA testing on several pieces of evidence, including hairs on duct tape, ridge detail (fingerprints) on tape, swabs from JJ\u2019s right hand fingernails and small dark spots on the handles of a shovel and pickax.\n\nMorgan spoke with EastIdahoNews.com about consumptive DNA testing, what it involves, what happens during an autopsy and how crucial DNA evidence testing is during a trial.\n\nWatch the entire interview in the video player above.\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "ST. ANTHONY \u2014 Prosecutors in the Chad and Lori Daybell murder cases are asking a judge to allow comprehensive DNA testing on several pieces of evidence.\n\nThe couple was charged a year ago with multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2014 two of Lori\u2019s kids \u2014 and Chad\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\nIn a motion filed Monday, Fremont County Prosecuting Attorney Lindsey Blake and Madison County Prosecuting Attorney Rob Wood asked Judge Steven Boyce to allow them to test the following items:\n\nRidge detail (fingerprints) on the adhesive side of tape associated with JJ Vallow\u0027s body\n\nSmall dark spots on the handles of a shovel and pickaxe recovered from a garage/barn \n\nSwabs of tape areas \n\nSwabs from JJ Vallow\u0027s right hand fingernails reportedly obtained during his autopsy\n\nProsecutors are asking for consumptive testing on the items, which means testing can only be done one time as it would completely consume the evidence.\n\nWood originally wanted consumptive DNA performed in April 2021, according to court documents, but Chad and Lori\u0027s attorneys objected. Lori\u0027s case was then put on hold after she was placed in the custody of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare.\n\nIn the motion filed this week, prosecutors note they have not had consumptive testing done on any materials up to this point but ask Boyce to now allow it.\n\nThe testing would normally be conducted at the Idaho State Police Forensic Services (ISPFS) Laboratory in Meridian but Lab Manager Rylene Nowlin submitted an affidavit asking Boyce to have it done elsewhere. Defense attorneys often have someone observe or videotape consumptive testing as it can only be done once. \n\n\u0022I affirm our (manual) restricts visitors from operational areas of the laboratory due to the risk of contamination and disruption of work,\u0022 Nowlin wrote. \u0022Due to the contamination risk, the risk of distraction that could lead to errors caused by having someone video the laboratory analysis, and the necessary shutdown of all other work in the laboratory during filming, the laboratory requests to have samples analyzed by an independent accredited DNA laboratory instead of requiring ISPFS to video analysis.\u0022\n\nNowlin confirms in her affidavit that testing performed on the items requested would consume them during analysis. \n\nProsecutors requested that Boyce schedule a hearing on the motion. It had not been set as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nChad and Lori Daybell have pleaded not guilty to all charges. Their trials will be held together in Ada County and are scheduled for January 2023.",

ANTHONY \u2014 A judge will issue a written order soon on whether Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s murder trial should be delayed to coincide with her husband\u2019s.\n\nDuring a hearing Thursday, prosecutors asked Judge Steven Boyce to continue the trial from October to January so Lori Daybell can be tried with Chad Daybell. The cases are currently conjoined but Lori did not waive her right to a speedy trial last month and legally must be tried within six months of arraignment.\n\nLori appeared for the hearing via Zoom from the Madison County Jail but did not say anything. Chad was not in attendance.\n\nWitnesses and evidence in both trials are the same and it will be more cost-effective to hold them together as proceedings are expected to last ten weeks, according to prosecutors. Postponing Lori\u2019s trial will also give both the prosecution and defense more time to prepare.\n\n\u201CThere is a mountain of evidence to review in this case and mitigation experts require significant time to prepare argument,\u201D Madison County Chief Deputy Prosecutor Tawnya Rawlings said. \u201CA number of outstanding issues, including DNA testing of certain evidence, was put off until the cases were brought together again and we think it\u2019s more equitable to continue to the January date.\u201D\n\nChad\u2019s attorney John Prior filed a motion in September to sever the trials from each other but Boyce denied the request.\n\nDuring the hearing, Prior said his preference is to maintain the January court date originally set for his client.\n\nIn court filings last week, Lori Daybell\u2019s defense attorneys wrote that her mental health is \u201Cextremely complex and fragile\u201D and while she does not want to waive her right to a speedy trial, Daybell understands a postponement \u201Cwill give her defense team more time to get ready.\u201D\n\n\u201CWe talk to Mrs. Daybell frequently and as recently as yesterday she acknowledged that she still has her right to a speedy trial and she is not going to waive that right,\u201D defense attorney Jim Archibald said Thursday. \u201CWe will be respectful of the court\u2019s decision whether it\u2019s an October trial setting or not\u2026Her defense team is spending a lot of time getting caught up since the state\u2019s been involved in this case for over two years\u2026but her defense team has not.\u201D\n\nRELATED | Lori Daybell\u2019s mental health is \u2018extremely complex and fragile,\u2019 attorneys say\n\nBoyce said he will issue a written decision soon as \u201Cimportant constitutional and statutory rights\u201D are a key factor in the matter.\n\nChad and Lori Daybell are charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2014 two of Lori\u2019s kids \u2014 and Chad\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell.

      "description": "ST. ANTHONY \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell was silent during an arraignment Tuesday, and her attorney asked the judge to enter a not guilty plea on her behalf to murder and other charges.\n\nSeated next to her attorneys, Jim Archibald and John Thomas, Daybell was dressed in a blue shirt, gray dress slacks and blue-framed glasses. She showed no emotion as District Judge Steven Boyce read out the felonies she faces in relation to the deaths of her children and current husband\u2019s first wife. Those charges include:\n\nFirst-degree murder in the death of Tylee Ryan\nFirst-degree murder in the death of JJ Vallow\nFirst-degree murder in the death of her current husband Chad Daybell\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell\nConspiracy to commit first-degree murder and grand theft by deception in the death of Tylee Ryan\nConspiracy to commit first-degree murder and grand theft by deception in the death of JJ Vallow\nConspiracy to commit first-degree murder in the death of Tammy Daybell\nGrand theft related to Social Security survivor benefits over $1,000 allocated for the care of minors Tylee Ryan and JJ Vallow that were appropriated after the children were missing and ultimately found deceased.\nArchibald indicated Daybell is not waiving her right to a speedy trial and her trial is currently scheduled with Chad\u2019s in January 2023.\n\nThis is Daybell\u2019s first public court hearing since she was declared incompetent for trial in June 2021. After spending 10 months in an Idaho Department of Health and Welfare facility, Boyce deemed her fit for trial last week and she was transferred to the Madison County Jail, where Fremont County female inmates are housed, early Thursday morning.\n\nJJ Vallow\u2019s grandparents, Larry and Kay Woodcock, along with Annie Cushing, Tylee Ryan\u2019s aunt, were at the arraignment. As the judge discussed JJ and his death, the Woodcocks broke down crying.\n\nThe arraignment happened about an hour after a separate hearing for Chad wrapped up. The focus of that hearing was the cost of busing jurors from Ada County to Fremont County for what was originally a joint trial. Prosecutors argued it will be significantly cheaper to have jurors brought in rather than holding proceedings in Boise. Chad\u2019s attorney asked the court to uphold its original decision.\n\nBoyce will issue a written ruling on the matter at a later date.\n\nChad also faces multiple counts of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and insurance fraud. He pleaded not guilty to all charges and remains in the Fremont County Jail.\n\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#EastIdahoNews #Daybell #LoriVallow\n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell will be making her way back to eastern Idaho in the coming days as proceedings in her murder trial are set to begin.\n\nDaybell has been at an Idaho Department of Health and Welfare facility in northern Idaho for 10 months since she was declared incompetent to stand trial. Earlier this week, District Judge Steven Boyce issued an order saying she is now fit to proceed and the stay, or pause, in her case has been lifted.\n\nOfficials remain tight-lipped as to how Daybell will be transported back to eastern Idaho. When she arrives, she will be housed in the Madison County Jail, where female inmates from Fremont County stay. Daybell stayed in this jail from March 2020 until June 2021, when she was declared incompetent.\n\nDaybell is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday at 1:30 p.m. in the Fremont County Courthouse. The hearing should be relatively short, and she will plead guilty or not guilty to the following crimes:\n\nFirst-degree murder in the death of Tylee Ryan\nFirst-degree murder in the death of JJ Vallow\nFirst-degree murder in the death of her current husband Chad Daybell\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell\nConspiracy to commit first-degree murder and grand theft by deception in the death of Tylee Ryan\nConspiracy to commit first-degree murder and grand theft by deception in the death of JJ Vallow\nConspiracy to commit first-degree murder in the death of Tammy Daybell\nGrand theft related to Social Security survivor benefits over $1,000 allocated for the care of minors Tylee Ryan and JJ Vallow that were appropriated after the children were missing and ultimately found deceased.\nFollowing the arraignment, Fremont County Prosecuting Attorney Lindsey Blake and Madison County Prosecuting Attorney Rob Wood have 60 days to declare if they intend to seek the death penalty against Daybell.\n\nRELATED | Prosecutors will seek the death penalty for Chad Daybell\n\n\u201CThat written notice has to list the aggravating factors that they would be using to seek the death penalty,\u201D says Bonneville County Prosecuting Attorney Alayne Bean, who is not associated with the Daybell case. \u201CYou can remove it or change it (the death penalty notice) once it\u2019s filed, but you can\u2019t start it at 61 days with something you didn\u2019t think of and didn\u2019t file the written notice.\u201D\n\nWATCH OUR ENTIRE INTERVIEW WITH ALAYNE BEAN IN THE VIDEO PLAYER ABOVE\n\nDaybell is represented by Jim Archibald, a public defender who is death-penalty certified. He has been the defense attorney in several high-profile cases, including Brian Dripps, who raped and killed Angie Dodge; and Erik Ohlson, who killed Jennifer Nalley and her unborn baby.\n\nWithin the coming weeks, additional attorneys will likely be appointed to help Archibald with his defense.\n\n\u201CThe jury has to find guilt on the charge, and then they go into a whole different process to evaluate the death penalty (if the death penalty is on the table),\u201D Bean says. \u201CYou\u2019d actually have a break (after the verdict), and the defense can bring in expert testimony about why the jury shouldn\u2019t do the death penalty. The state would have the opportunity to counter that mitigation expert.\u201D\n\nREAD THE ENTIRE STORY HERE: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2022/04/now-that-shes-competent-whats-next-for-lori-vallow-daybell/",

      "description": "#EastIdahoNews #Daybell\n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 JJ Vallow\u2019s grandparents are excited, relieved and ready to look Lori Vallow Daybell in the eyes after a judge ruled she is now fit for trial.\n\nLarry and Kay Woodcock admit they were stunned when they learned the news Monday morning but never doubted that Daybell would one day face a jury on murder charges.\n\n\u201CTo me, what it proves is that she has played the system her whole life, and she can\u2019t play it anymore,\u201D Larry Woodcock tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CI never believed that she was incompetent. I know her better than that. I truly believe she played the system the whole time.\u201D\n\nDaybell and her husband Chad Daybell are charged with multiple counts of conspiracy to commit murder and first-degree murder in relation to the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2014 two of Lori\u2019s kids \u2014 and Chad\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell. In Arizona, Lori is charged with conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the death of her previous husband Charles Vallow.\n\nDaybell\u2019s case in Idaho has been on hold since June, when she was declared incompetent for trial. District Judge Steven Boyce issued an order Monday saying she is now fit to proceed and ordered that Daybell be released from a Department of Health and Welfare facility in northern Idaho where she has been undergoing treatment since last summer.\n\nLarry Woodcock, who turns 75 years old on Tuesday, says the ruling is the best birthday present he could have been given this year.\n\n\u201CNow that they\u2019re both going to be sitting in a court across that (barrier) from me and Kay and our family \u2013 at some point in time, she is going to have to look at us,\u201D Larry says. \u201CI\u2019m not going to give her one inch. I\u2019m going to be right there behind her, just like I did with Chad.\u201D\n\nThe Woodcocks plan to travel to Fremont County from their Louisiana home on Tuesday, April 19, when Daybell is scheduled for her arraignment. They have not seen her since a court appearance in March 2020 after Daybell was arrested in Hawaii and flown to eastern Idaho.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown what type of treatments or medications Daybell has been prescribed over the past 10 months to help restore her competency, but Kay Woodcock believes Daybell likely hasn\u2019t changed much.\n\n\u201CMy guess is she is just in her own little world \u2026 not in a sick delusional way, but in a strong-willed, \u2018I\u2019m not guilty, and Chad and I did what was right. And that way I don\u2019t have to ever face the fact that I murdered my two kids and my husband,\u0027\u201D Kay says. \u201CI don\u2019t know that she\u2019ll ever realize or ever admit her guilt.\u201D\n\nSince Lori and Chad were arrested two years ago, the Woodcocks have patiently waited \u201Cfor the dominoes to fall.\u201D Although the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors caused delays in court proceedings, the couple says it\u2019s been a blessing in disguise.\n\n\u201CI think it\u2019s given us time to prepare emotionally for a lot of horrific things we\u2019re going to learn,\u201D Kay says. \u201CWe\u2019re being given time to prepare. I\u2019m better than I was, (Larry\u2019s) better than he was. It\u2019s a daily struggle still, but it\u2019s OK.\u201D\n\nOnce Daybell is arraigned, prosecutors have 60 days to declare if they will pursue the death penalty against her. They are pursuing the death penalty against Chad Daybell, and the Woodcocks say they don\u2019t care what punishment the duo receives as long as they are never free again.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019re going to be here. We are not giving up. I will never give up until I close my casket and then if I find her or him (Lori or Chad) after that, then I\u2019ll do what I have to do to them,\u201D Larry says.\n\nKay adds, \u201CI want her to feel us breathing down her neck.\u201D\n\nWatch our entire interview with Larry and Kay Woodcock in the video player above.\n\n \n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#EastIdahoNews #DaybellCase #Crime\n\nIDAHO FALLS \u2013 No final decision has been made regarding a motion to dismiss the case against Chad Daybell.\n\nDuring a hearing Wednesday morning, District Judge Stephen Boyce declined to issue a ruling pending submission of written briefs from defense and prosecuting attorneys.\n\nChad Daybell\u2019s attorney, John Prior, filed a motion to dismiss the case in a written memorandum last month, which he referenced in support of his argument throughout the hearing. The hearing was held over Zoom. Those in attendance were Boyce, Fremont County Prosecuting Attorney Lindsey Blake, Prior and Daybell.\n\nChad Daybell is charged with multiple counts of conspiracy to commit murder and first-degree murder in relation to the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and his first wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\nPrior cited pervasive media coverage playing a role in creating public bias. He argues the selection of grand jurors was not fair and impartial and that there should be \u201Chigher scrutiny and higher standards\u201D for selecting jurors and reviewing the proceedings.\n\n\u201CThe potential sentence in this case is death. The magnitude of the charge is what\u2019s important here,\u201D Prior said. \u201CWhen you\u2019re considering the validity or impartiality of a grand jury, you have to take into consideration the consequences as a result of that. So there needs to be a higher scrutiny and a higher review of the standards that are set forth.\u201D\n\nBlake focused on Idaho Criminal Rule 6.6 as grounds for dismissal of an indictment and repeatedly cited Idaho code 19-1003 in regards to challenging individual grand jurors.\n\nShe says the grand jury\u2019s role is not to determine guilt or innocence but to serve as an investigative body. Noting that distinction, she says a much higher standard is applied to the selection of a grand jury and no grounds have been established by the defendant that would support the indictment being set aside.\n\nBlake also noted the incomplete record of the grand jury proceedings, saying Idaho Criminal Rule 6.2A outlines \u201Call proceedings of the grand jury, except deliberations, must be recorded, either stenographically or electronically.\u201D\n\n\u201CThe defendant alleges the recordings were stopped at times and \u2026 we believe the proceedings were properly recorded, that there is no rule or statute the state can locate which would indicate that a recording should continue to be played if the prosecutors are conducting any sidebar (conversations) amongst themselves and/or if the parties are entering into a break,\u201D Blake said.\n\nThere was also some discussion about the secret nature of grand jury proceedings and whether or not the names of the jurors can be released.\n\nIn response, Prior said the state does not get to decide what information he has access to and that he is entitled to know who the jurors are and how they voted.\n\nBoyce concluded the hearing by authorizing voting rules to be revealed and that jurors will be identified by name and number. He will issue a written ruling on the motion to dismiss once written briefs have been provided by both parties.\n\nThe prosecution has until April 6 at 5 p.m. to submit a response to Prior\u2019s brief and the defense will issue a rebuttal by April 20. Due to the secret nature of grand jury proceedings, the written briefs will be sealed to the public.\n\nWATCH THE ENTIRE HEARING IN THE VIDEO ABOVE.\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahone...\n\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.co...\n\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newslet...",

      "description": "#EastIdahoNews #Daybell\n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 JJ Vallow\u2019s grandmother says she\u2019s \u201Crelieved\u201D after learning the murder trial for Chad and Lori Vallow Daybell will be held together after a judge rejected a request to separate the cases.\n\nIn a memorandum filed Monday, District Judge Steven Boyce denied John Prior\u2019s motion to sever the trials. Prior is Chad Daybell\u2019s attorney and argued during a hearing Friday that his client would not be given a fair and impartial trial if his proceedings were not separated from Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s.\n\nChad and Lori Daybell are charged with multiple counts of conspiracy to commit murder and first-degree murder in relation to the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2014 two of Lori\u2019s kids \u2014 and Chad\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell. The Daybells were both indicted at the same time, and the cases have been connected.\n\nLori Daybell\u2019s case has been on hold since June, as she was declared incompetent for trial, and Prior argued Friday that her uncertain status affects his defense strategy.\n\n\u201CDefendant\u2019s main argument centers on his contention that \u2018uncertainty\u2019 will result due to co-defendant Vallow\u2019s status and the stay in effect in her case,\u201D Boyce wrote in the eight-page memo. \u201CWhile the court does not dispute there may be an additional burden on the defense presented by an inability to know at this time whether co-defendant Vallow will be fit for trial when the trial begins, that \u2018uncertainty\u2019 in preparing for trial is not a determinative factor for the court to consider in reviewing Idaho Criminal Rule 14 (Relief from Prejudicial Joinder) or the cases interpreting it.\u201D\n\nBoyce wrote that having the trials together will be efficient, economic and avoid possible inconsistent verdicts. He said his decision should \u201Cin no way be construed as a stay on this case pending the competency determination\u201D of Lori Daybell and noted the trial will proceed as scheduled in Ada County on Jan. 9, 2023.\n\nKay Woodcock, JJ\u2019s grandmother, says she is happy with the decision.\n\n\u201CI am so relieved! Having the cases joined will save us from more emotional torture,\u201D she told EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CWe have already been through enough anguish from this evil duo. They\u2019ll be staring at each other in court feeling miserable they can\u2019t touch.\u201D\n\nPrior has also filed a motion to have the indictment and death penalty against Chad Daybell dismissed.

      "description": "#EastIdahoNews #Daybell\n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 Chad Daybell\u2019s attorney argued Friday that his client\u2019s murder trial should be held separate from Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s but prosecutors said having one trial will save money and is more efficient.\n\nJohn Prior\u2019s motion to sever was held via Zoom before District Judge Steven Boyce. Chad Daybell appeared next to Prior from the Fremont County Jail wearing a white dress shirt and dark tie. Daybell said nothing during the hearing.\n\nChad and Lori Daybell are charged with multiple counts of conspiracy to commit murder and first-degree murder in relation to the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2014 two of Lori\u2019s kids \u2014 and Chad\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell. They were both indicted at the same time and the cases are currently connected.\n\n\u201CWe have a trial that is set for January and it\u2019s fast approaching. There\u2019s a significant amount of preparation that needs to be done and there is going to be a significant difference as to how I prepare in the event the case is joined or separate,\u201D Prior said.\n\nIn a motion for severance filed in September, Prior argued that \u201Cif the cases and trial are not severed, the Defendant Chad Guy Daybell will not be afforded a fair and impartial trial.\u201D\n\nLori Daybell\u2019s case has been on hold since June as she was declared incompetent for trial. Few details about her mental health have been released because her case is sealed but earlier this month, court records show the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, along with two doctors, submitted reports to Boyce. It\u2019s unknown what those reports contain but a closed hearing was held in her case last Friday.\n\nFremont Prosecuting Attorney Lindsey Blake asked Boyce to wait on issuing a decision on separating the case until more information is available on Lori Daybell\u2019s case.\n\n\u201CIt would be most appropriate in the interest of judicial economy and to preserve all rights of the parties that Ms. Vallow Daybell also be allowed to be heard regarding a motion to sever since this also affects her trial rights,\u201D Blake said. \u201CWe believe that until a decision on the stay in her case is made, it would be premature to factor that into the decision to sever the cases.\u201D\n\nThe trial for both Daybells is scheduled to begin in January in Ada County and is expected to last ten weeks. Blake pointed out that if the cases are separated, there would be a \u201Csignificant impact with regard to costs for the counties involved as well as time for all the witnesses.\u201D\n\n\u201CIt would be 20 weeks to replicate the same evidence, require us to call all the same witnesses and use all the same staff and resources to do those trials,\u201D she said.\n\nPrior argued that his defense strategy will be different based on whether the cases remain joined or not. He asked Boyce to issue a decision soon.\n\n\u201CI don\u2019t want any delay, Judge. I need a decision one way or the other whether this thing is going to be severed because I have a significant amount of preparation that I\u2019m going to need to do and there\u2019s going to be an impact on which way this goes,\u201D Prior said.\n\nBoyce said he will consider the arguments and issue his decision in writing.\n\nPrior has also filed a motion to have the indictment and death penalty against Chad Daybell dismissed. A hearing on those issues is scheduled for March 23.\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to East Idaho News:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Eastidahonews?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25BA Download our free app: http://marketplace-redirect.doapps.com/3236\n\u25BA Like us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EastIdahoNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastIDNews\n\u25BA Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/eastidahonews/\n\u25BA Get East Idaho News merch:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/shop/\n\u25BA Subscribe to our free newsletter: https://www.eastidahonews.com/newsletter/",

      "description": "#EastIdahoNews #Daybell\n\nhttps://www.eastidahonews.com/2022/03/as-competency-questions-loom-whats-next-for-lori-vallow-daybell/\n\nST. ANTHONY \u2014 An update on whether Lori Vallow Daybell will stand trial on murder charges may be coming soon.\n\nDaybell was committed to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare on June 8 after a mental health professional deemed her incompetent for trial. Three months later, District Judge Steven Boyce extended her time in a state mental hospital by at least 180 days.\n\nThe 180-day mark was reached this week.\n\nDaybell and her husband Chad Daybell are charged with multiple counts of conspiracy to commit murder and first-degree murder in relation to the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2014 two of Lori\u2019s kids \u2014 and Chad\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\nVery few details about Lori Daybell\u2019s mental health have been released because her case is sealed but on Thursday, court records show the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, along with two doctors, submitted reports to Boyce.\n\n\u201CIt is hereby ordered that the (documents be sealed) because the information in the report concerns the defendant\u2019s mental health records and restorative treatment,\u201D an order from Boyce says. \u201CThe defendant\u2019s privacy interests in having her mental health treatment records remain confidential predominate over the public\u2019s interest in having the information disclosed.\u201D\n\nIn order for Daybell to be competent for trial, Idaho law says she must understand the proceedings against her and be able to assist in her own defense. There is no insanity defense in Idaho and it is rare for a case to be paused and never resume because of competency. Former Bonneville County Prosecuting Attorney Daniel Clark told EastIdahoNews.com in June that he had only seen that happen once in Bonneville County over the past 20 years.\n\nIf the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare believes Daybell has been restored to competency and Boyce agrees, she would be transferred back to the Madison County Jail, where female inmates from Fremont County are housed. Her case would resume with an initial court appearance on the following charges that were filed in May:\n\nConspiracy to commit first-degree murder and grand theft by deception for the death of Tylee Ryan\nConspiracy to commit first-degree murder and grand theft by deception for the death of JJ Vallow\nConspiracy to commit first-degree murder in the death of Tammy Daybell\nFirst-degree murder for the death of Tylee Ryan\nFirst-degree murder for the death of JJ Vallow\nGrand theft related to Social Security Survivor benefits over $1,000 allocated for Tylee Ryan and JJ Vallow\nDaybell\u2019s case is currently joined with Chad Daybell\u2019s, but his attorney John Prior has filed a motion to sever them. Prosecutors object to the severance and a hearing on the matter is scheduled for Friday, March 18.\n\nPrior has also filed motions to have the indictment and death penalty against Chad Daybell dismissed, along with motions to have prosecutors in the case disqualified. A hearing on those issues will be held Wednesday, March 23.",

      "description": "ST. ANTHONY \u2014 District Judge Steven Boyce postponed a motion hearing for Lori Vallow Daybell Wednesday due to the recent removal of her privately hired attorney Mark Means.\n\nThe purpose of the hearing was to hear from attorneys representing the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Both parties were seeking to modify or quash subpoenas previously filed by Means. Daybell\u2019s former attorney had suggested she was being manipulated by the department and the church, which led him to initially file the subpoenas.\n\nDaybell\u2019s appointed public defender Jim Archibald suggested the hearing be postponed because he wanted to speak to his client about the recent changes in representation.\n\n\u201CLast night and seeing the court order, disqualifying Mr. Means, I\u2019m wondering about what Mrs. Lori Vallow Daybell understands about this hearing,\u201D Archibald said in court Wednesday.\n\nDaybell is currently committed to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare after being deemed incompetent to assist in her own defense. Archibald said he understands Daybell watches the hearings while in a state mental health facility and she may just be learning about Means\u2019 removal.\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s brief hearing, Boyce also discussed the potential resolution to the subpoenas without holding a future hearing.\n\nArchibald did not sign the subpoenas originally issued by Means, and Boyce indicated the subpoenas could be resolved outside of court.\n\nA date for a potential new hearing was not scheduled.\n\nDaybell and her husband Chad face multiple crimes, including conspiracy to commit murder and first-degree murder. The charges are in relation to the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2014 two of Lori\u2019s kids \u2014 and Chad\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell.",

      "description": "CHANDLER, Arizona -- A phone call released Thursday afternoon from the Chandler Police Department reveals a conversation between a detective and Alex Cox\u0027s ex-wife where she shares a bizarre relationship Cox allegedly had with his sister Lori Vallow Daybell. \n\nMarriage records previously obtained by EastIdahoNews.com show Cox married a woman named Debbie in 1992. The couple divorced the following year, but when the Daybell case broke, she contacted a Chandler, Arizona detective who recorded the interview in September 2020. Debbie\u0027s last name was redacted in police reports and EastIdahoNews.com is not reporting it.\n\n\u0022There were so many crazy dynamics in that family,\u0022 Debbie told investigators. \u0022... It caused a lot of issues right away and it actually made me scared and nervous.\u0022 \n\nThe ex-wife described a lot of inappropriate sexual touching between Cox and Daybell. According to the call and a Chandler Police report, Debbie said the brother and sister would simulate sex acts in front of her and the rest of the family.\n\n\u0022He also talked about (how she was) hot and he sexualized her quite a bit. He did touch her breast and things,\u0022 Debbie said. \u0022Alex and I only lived together married about four or five months. Then I just knew that family was too weird and that I made a big mistake so I got out.\u0022\n\nCox reportedly saw nothing wrong with the behavior and arguments ensued between him and his now ex-wife. Cox told Debbie he had a problem controlling his sex drive.\n\n\u0022While he and I were married he got excommunicated from the Mormon church,\u0022 Debbie said. \u0022... He was always really convicted in the faith, but where Alex is weak is he was just sexually promiscuous (and) he kept getting kicked out of the church because I think he was a sex addict.\u0022\n\nDebbie reported she learned Cox slept with a 15-year-old girl and the teen\u0027s father began looking for him to take care of the problem on his own. She said there was \u0022too much promiscuity surrounding sex in our marriage early on\u0022 and that played into their divorce.\n\nThe marriage between Debbie and Cox lasted only a year but the two maintained in touch for years, according to Debbie. She says the last time she spoke to Cox was shortly after he got out of jail for attacking Daybell\u0027s third husband, Joseph Ryan, in Texas. \n\nIn the years following the last conversation Debbie had with Cox, he shot and killed Daybell\u0027s fourth husband, Charles Vallow, in July 2019. Cox died in December 2019 in the months after his sister\u0027s two children 7-year-old Joshua \u0022JJ\u0022 Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan vanished. \n\nInvestigators found Tylee and JJ\u0027s bodies buried in the backyard of Daybell\u0027s fifth husband, Chad Daybell, in June 2020. \n\nListen to the entire conversation with Debbie and the detective in the video player above.",

      "description": "The day after Alex Cox and Zulema Pastenes were married in Las Vegas, he offered to give her a massage.\n\nIt was Saturday, Nov. 30, 2019 in the middle of the day. Cox, a massage therapist, had never given Pastenes a massage and said they needed to go to Walmart first to buy a large plastic drop cloth commonly used for painting projects.\n\nThey purchased the item, returned to their room and he spread the cloth over the bed. Pastenes remembers lying down and quickly falling asleep.\n\n\u201CI was really, really (relaxed) \u2013 like when you\u2019re trying to wake up and can\u2019t,\u201D Pastenes recalled. \u201CI was thinking, \u2018Why am I so relaxed and can\u2019t wake up?\u2019 I was in and out and could hear him talking and I was like, \u2018Who is he talking to?\u0027\u201D\n\nPastenes said it sounded like Cox was chatting with somebody on the phone in the bathroom. When she was finally able to wake herself up, she asked her new husband who he had been talking to.\n\n\u201CHe\u2019s like, \u2018Nobody. I was talking to myself,\u0027\u201D Pastenes said.\n\nShe took a bath and then suggested to Cox that they should watch a movie together. He was doing something on his phone and acted \u201Csuper quiet.\u201D\n\n\u201CAlex is usually joking and he would find a way to turn things into a joke. He was always making you laugh but he said nothing for the rest of the evening,\u201D Pastenes said. \u201CI asked if he was ok and he said, \u2018I\u2019m just tired.\u2019 The fact he was quiet and said nothing \u2013 that\u2019s so not Alex. Alex is not quiet.\u201D\n\nPastenes explained the unusual events of that day to detectives from the Rexburg Police Department and Fremont County Sheriff\u2019s Office who met with her for two hours this past April in Arizona. The interview, which you can watch in its entirety at the end of this story, was videotaped and part of several recordings, documents, videos and other files released Wednesday from the Chandler Police Department.\n\nRELATED | Arizona police release gigabytes of never before seen videos in Daybell investigation\n\nThe department has been investigating the death of Charles Vallow, Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s fourth husband who was shot and killed by Cox in July 2019. Lori married Chad Daybell four months later, weeks after Chad\u2019s wife, Tammy Daybell, died in her sleep.\n\nLori\u2019s two children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan, were found buried on Chad\u2019s property in June 2020. The couple is facing multiple charges in connection to JJ, Tylee and Tammy\u2019s deaths, and police reports suggest Cox was involved. Lori has also been indicted in Arizona for conspiracy to commit murder in Charles\u2019s death.\n\nRELATED | Messages reveal romantic relationship between Chad and Lori Daybell before Tammy Daybell\u2019s death\n\nThe detectives met with Pastenes and her attorney Garrett Smith to follow up on earlier statements she had made to them in regards to Chad, Lori and Cox.\n\n\u201CAt the time (of the massage), I had no question about it,\u201D she told them. \u201CThere was not enough oil for a drop cloth (and) now I\u2019m like, \u2018Why would you necessitate a whole drop cloth all over the bed to give me a massage?\u2019 That doesn\u2019t make any sense to me at all \u2026 Maybe I\u2019m just a little too crazy because of all the stuff that\u2019s happened, but in the back of my mind I keep thinking that who was on the phone was Chad and Lori and that was supposed to be my last day.\u201D\n\nPastenes doesn\u2019t remember eating or drinking anything unusual that afternoon and said it was the only time Cox ever gave her a massage.\n\nRead the entire story here: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2021/10/alex-coxs-widow-tells-police-about-a-hidden-bag-and-the-bizarre-massage-he-gave-her-zulema-pastenes/",

Last month, Boyce asked for a progress report on her condition after getting letters asking for her commitment to be extended. By law he was required to review the status of her case within 90 days of the initial commitment.\n\nDaybell and her husband Chad Daybell are charged with multiple counts of conspiracy to commit murder and first-degree murder, among other crimes. The charges are in relation to the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2014 two of Lori\u2019s kids \u2014 and Chad\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\nChad also appeared in the Zoom hearing with his attorney John Prior to discuss moving his November trial to a later date.\n\nBoyce explained the prosecution and defense still need to continue the exchange of evidence and a change of venue hearing still needs to be held.\n\nAdditionally, Prior also filed a motion Tuesday, asking the trial for Lori and Chad to be held separately. In the motion, Prior says Chad can not have a fair trial if it is held alongside his wife.\n\nA change of venue hearing for Chad is scheduled for Oct. 5 and 6 at the Fremont County courthouse. A trial will not be set until after the change of venue hearing.\n\nA portion of the hearings were also taken off the record after about 10 minutes.",

      "description": "IDAHO FALLS \u2014 Gerry Vallow wasn\u2019t sure what to say when his 9-year-old granddaughter asked, \u201CWhat happened to Uncle Charles?\u201D\n\nIt was another reminder that his older brother was gone \u2013 shot and killed in a Chandler, Arizona, home two years ago this month.\n\n\u201CI just lost it. And anytime anyone talks about it, I kind of lose it. It\u2019s an emotional thing, and we\u2019re supposed to be macho guys, but this is beyond that,\u201D Gerry Vallow tells EastIdahoNews.com during a Zoom interview with his wife, Melanie Vallow, from their Texas home.\n\nGerry has not spoken publicly about his brother\u2019s death or the criminal cases involving Lori Vallow Daybell and Chad Daybell. Both are facing multiple charges in Idaho for the deaths of Lori\u2019s children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan, and Chad\u2019s wife, Tammy Daybell. A grand jury in Arizona indicted Lori on Thursday for conspiracy to commit the murder of Charles Vallow. Her brother, Alex Cox, shot and killed Charles. Cox died \u2014 of natural causes \u2014 five months later in December 2019.\n\n\u201CI would just like to sit down and look Lori in the eyes and talk to her. I really would. I\u2019d like to ask her a couple of questions,\u201D Gerry says. \u201CI would tell her she is not some reincarnated deity. She\u2019s not some god on earth that\u2019s going to lead people to the end of the world when Jesus comes.\u201D\n\nCharles was two years older than Gerry, and the two brothers grew up playing baseball together. Charles was funny, positive and a \u201Cpleasure to be around,\u201D according to Gerry and Melanie. They admit he wasn\u2019t perfect, but he was a good guy who was \u201Ccrazy in love\u201D with Lori.\n\nMelanie and Gerry knew Lori and Charles were experiencing some marital problems but said Charles was determined to make things work. About a month before he was killed, he and JJ visited Melanie, who was recovering from a serious illness.\n\n\u201CCharles traveled a lot to Houston where we live, and he stayed with us, so I had a lot of time with him,\u201D Melanie recalls. \u201CThis has been very difficult for me because he and I got along very, very well. He said Lori was going to move to Houston and try to work it out. I asked him if he thought it was a good idea, and he said, \u2018I gotta make it work.\u2019 He loved her.\u201D\n\nGerry learned Charles was dead when his sister, Kay Woodcock, phoned him and another brother on a conference call. He said he couldn\u2019t comprehend the news and did not want to talk about it with anyone.\n\nThree or four months ago, as he was sitting on the back porch thinking about the chain of events, he says he lost it.\n\n\u201CIt just hit me. I\u2019m not a mad guy or angry, but I went into a rage. An anger got to me that I didn\u2019t understand. I\u2019ve never felt that mad before,\u201D he says. \u201CI called a friend, and she told me I have to talk about it. I always hold things in, but she said to let people hear about my brother and start talking about it.\u201D\n\nMelanie and Gerry have followed the events of the past two years \u2013 from Lori and Chad fleeing to Hawaii, their arrests, the discovery of JJ and Tylee\u2019s bodies in Chad\u2019s backyard, murder charges and now a court decision that Lori is incompetent for trial.\n\nWhen asked for his reaction to the competency ruling, Gerry is blunt.\n\n\u201CShe ain\u2019t crazy. That b**** knew exactly what she was doing. And that\u2019s the truth,\u201D he says.\n\nMelanie adds, \u201CI\u2019m hoping she becomes competent really soon. I\u2019m going to let the Lord handle that. I\u2019d rather not judge her competency even though I know full well she knew what she was doing.\u201D\n\nMelanie says she prays for Lori every night, and despite being a death penalty advocate, she and Gerry hope Lori and Chad spend the rest of their lives in prison as death \u201Cis an easy way out.\u201D Idaho prosecutors have not yet indicated if they plan to pursue the death penalty.\n\nThe Vallows know \u201Cjustice takes time\u201D and are being patient with the court system. They say they don\u2019t hate Lori, and regardless of how the complicated criminal cases are resolved, they trust in a higher power.\n\n\u201CThe creator of the universe will judge her. Not me. That gives me comfort because I\u2019m not a judge,\u201D Gerry says. \u201CI don\u2019t hate. I don\u2019t allow that emotion in my heart. In a way, I feel sorry for her.\u201D",

      "description": "CHANDLER, Arizona \u2014 Disturbing new details and text messages released Thursday indicate the killing of Charles Vallow was planned and reveal more about Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s extreme religious beliefs.\n\nArizona investigators say a series of crimes that surrounded the July 11, 2019, shooting death of Vallow was not a \u201Ccoincidence or justifiable.\u201D Local and federal investigations have also uncovered more information surrounding the deaths of Lori\u2019s two children, JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan, as well as the death of Tammy Daybell, the wife of Lori\u2019s fifth husband, Chad Daybell.\n\nThe planning of Vallow\u2019s death\n\nDetectives say the first time evidence pointed at harm towards Vallow surfaced on Nov. 3, 2018. According to police, text messages between Lori and the now-widow of her brother Alex Cox were uncovered after seizing a phone when Cox died. The name of widow and friend of Lori is redacted in court documents. However, it is known Cox was married to a woman named Zulema Pastenes at the time of her death.\n\nPolice say that on Nov. 3, 2018, a person texted Lori saying \u201Cshe was told by God that she is to protect\u201D her. Then in January 2019, a person told Lori, \u201CShe had a vision that she could create storms and fire and will have the eye of the Lord.\u201D A month later, Lori texted a person saying Charles was blocking her gifts. A redacted portion of the conversation that refers to causing harm to Vallow follows. In the conversations, Vallow is referred to as a dark spirit called \u201CHiplos\u201D or \u201CNed.\u201D\n\nInvestigators say Lori believed she was an exalted goddess directed to lead the 144,000 with Chad to prepare for the end of the world. Both Chad and Lori believe they had \u201Cextraordinary abilities,\u201D including teleportation, causing harm to others, calling up natural disasters, praying away demonic spirits and having visions.\n\nOn June 3, 2019, Lori texted a person saying, \u201CJust got home and got jj to sleep. Let\u2019s go spiritually tonight and work on him. We give the timing to the Lord but we don\u2019t need to relent. This is war.\u201D Then on June 19, 2019, a person texts Lori saying, \u201COh and can you meet me at the temple in the morning? I have time tomorrow and we can work on Hiplos.\u201D\n\nAlso, in June, investigators say Lori searched the internet for Social Security disability information. Police theorize that because of a message sent to Chad, Lori determined she would receive $4,000 a month in Social Security benefits if Vallow died.\n\nMore redacted messages follow, but this time Cox joins in the conversation. In the weeks leading up to Vallow\u2019s death, the unnamed friend, Cox and Chad all converse about Vallow, referring to him as \u201CHiplos.\u201D\n\n\u201CThere is no obvious communication found between Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell to show that he was directly involved with the planning of Charles Vallow\u2019s murder,\u201D police wrote in the document.\n\nJust two days before Vallow was shot and killed, Lori discovered a planned \u201Cintervention\u201D from Vallow and her other brother. Vallow had asked Lori to come clean about her relationship with Chad, or he would tell Tammy Daybell of their relationship.\n\nThe day Charles Vallow was killed\n\nAround 7:35 a.m. on July 11, 2019, Vallow arrived at Lori\u2019s home to pick up JJ. Vallow texted a person whose name has been redacted that Cox was there, and the person responded that Lori and Cox were planning something. Soon after, Vallow was shot and killed.\n\nInvestigators began their homicide investigation and interviewed \u201Call pertinent parties.\u201D During the investigation, police say there was concern about a bullet strike on the ground near Vallow\u2019s body. Investigators were also concerned about the timeline of events.\n\nRead more here: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2021/07/documents-giving-more-insights-into-bizarre-beliefs-the-daybells-and-death-of-charles-vallow/",

      "description": "IDAHO FALLS \u2014 I never thought I\u2019d be writing a story about a guy playing me in a movie.\n\nSure, I\u2019ve interviewed Nate Eaton, the baseball player, but both Spencer Lord and I agree our Zoom conversation a few days ago was \u201Csurreal.\u201D\n\nLord plays me in \u201CDoomsday Mom: The Lori Vallow Story,\u201D a movie scheduled to air on Lifetime this Saturday. It\u2019s a role he never imagined back in 2016 having just graduated with a mechanical engineering degree from the University of British Columbia.\n\n\u201CGrowing up, I was pretty good in school, so I went to the guidance counselor and was told I should try engineering because I was good at psychics,\u201D Lord recalls. \u201CBut I got a job and realized it wasn\u2019t my forte or passion, so I thought back to what I could do that sparked some passion in me.\u201D\n\nLord hated his job and remembered his 12th-grade friends recruiting him to try out for the play \u201CKiss Me, Kate,\u201D where he was cast as Fred, the lead role. He sang three solos and fell in love with acting.\n\nNow, years later, Lord decided to follow his dreams and leave engineering behind.\n\n\u201CI was going to give my boss my two weeks\u2019 notice, and he comes and sits down in my office,\u201D Lord tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CI could tell what was going to happen \u2026 and he let me go before I was able to quit, which was OK because that meant I got unemployment.\u201D\n\nThe money helped Lord transition to serving tables at a restaurant while taking acting classes.\n\nOne year later, in 2017, he was cast in his first role \u2013 Terry, an \u201Coddball\u201D with a tickle fetish, in the CW series \u201CRiverdale.\u201D\n\n\u201CI had a couple of days on set for two episodes, and it ended up being a great learning experience,\u201D Lord explains. \u201CThere was a lot of learning to be done in a very short period of time.\u201D\n\nSince then, Lord has been cast in supporting lead actor roles but has never played a real person \u2013 until now.\n\n\u201CIt was nerve-wracking at first, but it was great \u2013 especially playing you \u2013 because you have hundreds of videos online reporting and interviewing people,\u201D Lord told me during a Zoom conversation. \u201CSo in a way, it was simple but wasn\u2019t as easy. \u2026 I watched hundreds of minutes of you and watched how you sit, the intonations in your voice and then tried to mimic the way you speak.\u201D\n\nLord was unfamiliar with the Daybell case, a story full of twists-and-turns spanning several states and people. You can get caught up on the latest here.\n\nThe Canadian actor had about a week to prepare for the movie and says several scenes are nearly verbatim from my reporting \u2013 including him approaching actors playing Chad and Lori Daybell in Hawaii.\n\n\u201C(I) started watching all the work you\u2019ve done, and (the story) is bizarre, it\u2019s terrible and the fact that she\u2019s been deemed incompetent \u2013 it\u2019s kind of wild,\u201D Lord says. \u201CIt\u2019s an interesting look at the judicial system as well in how everything shakes out.\u201D\n\nLord has other projects that are set to air in the coming months. His role model is Jake Gyllenhaal, and hopes to one day \u201Cdo it all\u201D \u2013 perform on Broadway, work on a gritty true-detective-type TV show, act in a romantic comedy and who knows? Maybe play another news reporter down the line.\n\n\u201CI sincerely hope I did you and your profession and passion justice,\u201D he tells me. \u201CIf nothing else, that was my goal.\u201D\n\n\u201CDoomsday Mom: The Lori Vallow Story\u201D airs Saturday, June 26, at 8/7c on Lifetime.

As with all this, is comes over in a wave of emotion and it just makes it more real,\u201D she said after the hearing. \u201CIt just seemed surreal for a long time and as you accept it more and more, things just get to be more real.\u201D\n\nRELATED | Chad Daybell pleads not guilty to murder and other charges\n\nDaybell and his wife, Lori Vallow Daybell, were indicted by a grand jury May 24.

      "description": "IDAHO FALLS \u2014 Although a psychologist has said Lori Vallow Daybell is not competent for trial right now, a judge still needs to legally declare it, and a pause in court proceedings could only be temporary.\n\nDaybell and husband Chad Daybell are charged with multiple counts of conspiracy to commit murder and first-degree murder, among other crimes. The charges are in relation to the killings of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan \u2014 two of Lori\u2019s kids \u2014 and Chad\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\nMark Means, Daybell\u2019s defense attorney, requested a psychological evaluation for his client in March. A licensed clinical psychologist met with Daybell in the Madison County Jail on at least two days and, according to court documents filed last week, determined \u201Cthe defendant was not competent to proceed.\u201D Restorative treatment was recommended.\n\nBonneville County Prosecutor Danny Clark, who has nothing to do with the Daybell case, has seen similar situations play out in his 20 years of prosecuting crimes.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s a very well-educated opinion on her competency \u2026 but ultimately, the determination of competency is a judicial ruling made by a judge. That has not occurred as of yet,\u201D Clark tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CCompetency is a very specific thing. It does not mean there isn\u2019t a mental illness. It doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t suffer from certain things. It means simply comprehending or understanding the proceedings against them.\u201D\n\nIn order for Daybell to be competent for trial, Idaho law says she must understand the proceedings against her and be able to assist in her own defense. If Judge Steven Boyce rules she cannot, hearings are put on hold for 90 days.\n\nDaybell will likely be placed in a facility for treatment with the goal of getting her competent. If that happens, court proceedings resume as normal. If not, the pause extends another 180 days, and she would continue to receive treatment.\n\n\u201CIf the defendant is then deemed to be not competent and not likely to become competent, they are committed to Department of Health and Welfare until they become competent,\u201D Clark says.\n\nThere is no insanity defense in Idaho, and it is \u201Cvery, very rare\u201D for a case to be paused and never resume because of competency, according to Clark. He has only seen that happen once in Bonneville County over the past two decades.\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s a lot of cases, a lot of evaluations, a lot of findings of incompetency that later are determined competent,\u201D he says. \u201CI would imagine this would be similar to those cases. \u2026 I\u2019ve had cases where someone was determined to be incompetent three times on the case before it got to a conclusion. It might take some time, but it almost always moves forward.\u201D\n\nIn more cases, defense attorneys ask for psychological exams because they spend more time with their clients than prosecuting attorneys. The requests usually happen shortly after someone is taken into custody, but in Daybell\u2019s case, Means asked for an exam a year after she was booked into the Madison County Jail.\n\nAlthough that might seem unusual, Clark says it\u2019s not unheard of.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ve had cases where the defense attorney brought the issue up six months into the case, and we all respected his or her decision to bring the issue up at that stage based on what they were seeing,\u201D he says.\n\nMadison County Prosecuting Attorney Rob Wood disputes the findings in Daybell\u2019s psychological report, according to court documents, so he could argue that it be thrown out or request a second opinion.\n\nA hearing on the matter has been scheduled for June 16 at 9 a.m. where Boyce will decide how to proceed.",

      "description": "IDAHO FALLS \u2014 A retired FBI agent says prosecutors and investigators have done a good job \u201Cputting together the puzzle pieces\u201D that led to murder charges against Chad and Lori Daybell.\n\nFrank Montoya worked for the FBI over 25 years and served in a variety of high-profile positions, including the head of national counterintelligence and as the special agent in charge of the Honolulu and Seattle divisions. Montoya oversaw counterintelligence squads and led several national security investigations but says he has never seen a case like the Daybells.\n\nRELATED | With Chad and Lori Daybell on the move, retired FBI agent explains what could happen next\n\n\u201CThe indictments really illustrate how this complex case, with all these twists and turns, just how intensive, time-consuming and difficult it can be to put everything together,\u201D Montoya tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CIt was a painstaking, lengthy process but they needed to put together all the pieces.\u201D\n\nMontoya was not surprised to learn a grand jury found enough evidence to indict the Daybells for murder, conspiracy to commit murder and other crimes. From the beginning, many have assumed the couple was connected to the death of Lori\u2019s children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan, along with Chad\u2019s wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\n\u201COne of the very big challenges of these cases is you pretty much know who did it but you have to prove who did it. That\u2019s not as easy as it might seem and this is not a 60 minute crime show,\u201D Montoya says.\n\nThe indictments lay out some details about the alleged crimes, such as allegations that Lori and Chad sent text messages to each other \u201Cregarding death percentages for Tammy and JJ\u201D three months before Tammy died. Investigators also found texts between the couple about Tammy being \u201Cpossessed by a spirit named Viola.\u201D\n\nBut a lot of information, including how Tammy and the children died, was not contained in the court documents.\n\n\u201CYou don\u2019t want to reveal all of your trial strategy in your indictment because that provides the defense with many more opportunities to craft its own defense,\u201D Montoya says. \u201CIt\u2019s very prudent the prosecution lays out a sufficiently detailed indictment while not exposing everything because they still have a prosecution to look forward to.\u201D\n\nProsecutors Rob Wood and Lindsey Blake address Chad and Lori\u2019s religious beliefs in the indictments by saying they were used \u201Cfor the purpose of encouraging and/or justifying\u201D the alleged homicides. As the case progresses, Montoya believes that could play a major part and we could learn \u201Cif they are super committed or is it just a cover for sex, greed and a lust of money?\u201D\n\nREAD: Here is the indictment document for murder against Chad and Lori Daybell\n\nAt a minimum, it will be months before a trial is held on the new charges. Between now and then, Chad or Lori could enter a plea agreement and share what they know with investigators.\n\nMontoya says those involved in this case from the very beginning should be applauded for their work.\n\n\u201CThe point of justice being served for these victims \u2013 JJ, Tylee and Tammy \u2013 absolutely depended on the cooperation and efforts of all of these agencies working together,\u201D Montoya says. \u201CThat\u2019s what you saw yesterday was a culmination of all these efforts.\u201D\n\nWatch our entire interview with Montoya in the video player above.",

Based on previous court hearings we know that all of Lori\u2019s future court proceedings were put on hold in March for an undetermined amount of time, for an unknown reason.\n\nPrior to Lori\u2019s hearing, her husband Chad Daybell appeared in court over Zoom from the Fremont County Jail with his attorney John Prior. The charges were read against Chad, and the judge affirmed Chad would be held without bail. Prior did not object to that decision.\n\nThe two court appearances come following the convening of a grand jury in Fremont County last week. On Monday the grand jury indicted the couple on variety of charges including first-degree murder for the deaths of Chad\u2019s first wife Tammy Daybell, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow \u2014 Lori\u2019s two children.\n\nThe couple was served warrants Tuesday. Both Chad and Lori were already behind bars on $1 million bail for charges related to the concealment and destruction of the bodies of the children.\n\nWood and Fremont County Prosecutor Lindsey Blake announced the indictment at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. The Daybells are charged with the following:\n\nLori and Chad Daybell were indicted on the charge of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and grand theft by deception for the death of Tylee Ryan.\n\nLori and Chad Daybell were indicted on the charge of first-degree murder for the death of Tylee Ryan.\n\nLori and Chad Daybell were indicted on the charge of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and grand theft by deception for the death of JJ Vallow.\nLori and Chad Daybell were indicted on the charge of first-degree murder for the death of JJ Vallow.\n\nLori and Chad Daybell were indicted on the charge of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in the death of Tammy Daybell.\n\nChad Daybell was indicted on the charge of first-degree murder in the death of his wife Tammy Daybell.\n\nLori Daybell was indicted on the charge of grand theft related to Social Security Survivor benefits over $1,000 allocated for the care of minors Tylee Ryan and JJ Vallow that were appropriated after the children were missing and ultimately found deceased.\n\nChad Daybell was indicted on the charge of insurance fraud related to a life insurance policy he had on Tammy Daybell for which he was the beneficiary and received funds after her death.\n\nChad Daybell was indicted on the charge of insurance fraud related to another life insurance policy he had on Tammy Daybell for which he was the beneficiary and received funds after her death.\n\nIn addition to the charges, additional details surrounding the deaths of Tylee, JJ and Tammy, were also released. Charging documents indicate investigators believe Lori\u2019s brother Alex Cox was a co-conspirator in the alleged crimes.\n\nBoth Chad and Lori could face the death penalty with the first-degree murder charges. If prosecutors decide to not seek the death penalty, the couple could receive multiple life sentences with a mandatory minimum of 10 years.\n\nThe arraignment for Chad is scheduled for June 9. It\u2019s not clear when Lori\u2019s initial appearance will resume.",

Wood, a special prosecutor in the case, was joined by local, state, federal law enforcement and other officials.\n\nThe news comes after a grand jury convened over the past week in Fremont County.\n\nThe following are charges Chad and Lori are facing, according to a news release sent after Wood and Fremont County Prosecutor Lindsey Blake met with the media Tuesday afternoon:\n\nLori and Chad Daybell were indicted on the charge of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and grand theft by deception for the death of Tylee Ryan.\nLori and Chad Daybell were indicted on the charge of first-degree murder for the death of Tylee Ryan.\nLori and Chad Daybell were indicted on the charge of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and grand theft by deception for the death of JJ Vallow.\nLori and Chad Daybell were indicted on the charge of first-degree murder for the death of JJ Vallow.\nLori and Chad Daybell were indicted on the charge of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in the death of Tammy Daybell.\nChad Daybell was indicted on the charge of first-degree murder in the death of his wife Tammy Daybell.\nLori Daybell was indicted on the charge of grand theft related to Social Security Survivor benefits over $1,000 allocated for the care of minors Tylee Ryan and JJ Vallow that were appropriated after the children were missing and ultimately found deceased.\nChad Daybell was indicted on the charge of insurance fraud related to a life insurance policy he had on Tammy Daybell for which he was the beneficiary and received funds after her death.\nChad Daybell was indicted on the charge of insurance fraud related to another life insurance policy he had on Tammy Daybell for which he was the beneficiary and received funds after her death.\nThe penalty for the murder charges range from life in prison without the possibility of parole to the death penalty, Blake said. Prosecutors were not disclosing what penalty they will pursue, but if they decide on the death penalty, legally they have to notify Lori and Chad within 60 days of their plea.\n\n\nGrand jury proceedings are held in strict confidence and are sealed from the public, so it\u2019s unknown what evidence and information-led the jury to indict.\n\nWood and Blake released few details about the indictments but expressed thanks to the public for being patient over the past year.\n\nThe indictments come nearly one year after the bodies of 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, were found buried on Chad\u2019s Fremont County property. He was arrested June 9 on two felony counts of conspiracy to commit destruction, alteration or concealment of evidence, and two felony counts of destruction, alteration or concealment of evidence.\n\nTylee\u2019s body was dismembered and burned, according to court documents. JJ\u2019s body was wrapped in tight black plastic and secured with gray duct tape.\n\n\nChad pleaded not guilty to the charges and has been in the Fremont County Jail on a $1 million bail.\n\nLori was arrested on Feb. 20, 2020, in Kauai, Hawaii, and extradited to Rexburg. She was charged with two felony charges of conspiracy to commit destruction, alteration or concealment of evidence and has been in the Madison County Jail on a $1 million bail. Lori pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nChad and Lori married weeks after Chad\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell, suddenly died on Oct. 19, 2019. The couple fled to Hawaii as police began investigating the disappearance of JJ and Tylee. Tammy\u2019s death has been under investigation for over a year and an autopsy was complete in February, but results and her cause of death have not been released to the public.\n\nLori\u2019s former husband, Charles Vallow, was shot and killed by Lori\u2019s brother, Alex Cox, in July 2019. Cox said the shooting was in self-defense, but the investigation is still open. Cox died of natural causes in December 2019, according to the Maricopa County, Arizona, medical examiner.\n\nEastIdahoNews.com confronted Chad and Lori in Hawaii in January 2020, and they refused to say where the children were. The case was thrust into the national spotlight, but the COVID-19 pandemic slowed progress down as grand juries were unable to meet.\n\nHowever, Wood said authorities have spent \u201Cthousands of hours \u2026 seeking the truth for these innocent victims,\u201D and Blake said the case has been moving forward behind the scenes.",

      "description": "REXBURG \u2014 Law enforcement conducted DNA testing on tools seized from Chad Daybell\u2019s property and a possible blood sample found at an apartment.\n\nThat\u2019s according to court documents filed Tuesday by Madison County Special Prosecutor Rob Wood in connection to the Chad and Lori Vallow Daybell case. Both are charged with conspiracy to conceal or destroy evidence, and Chad is charged with concealment/destruction of evidence after the bodies of Lori\u2019s children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan, were found buried on Chad\u2019s Salem property last summer.\n\nWood\u2019s filing comes in response to a motion from John Prior, Chad\u2019s attorney, and Mark Means, Lori\u2019s attorney. The defense lawyers asked Judge Steven Boyce for an expedited hearing in regards to DNA testing being conducted by law enforcement.\n\nThat hearing was scheduled for Wednesday afternoon but was postponed as both Wood and the defense attorneys are requesting information from the state lab so they could potentially reach an agreement on the issue.\n\nThe hearing was scheduled after Prior asked Boyce to order the prosecution to do the following:\n\nNot pursue any testing on remaining DNA samples until the defense can obtain half of all samples for their own testing.\nProvide all records, reports and documentation related to testing that has already been performed.\nAllow the defendant\u2019s DNA expert to go directly to any lab to review, copy, photograph and document procedures that will be done in the future or have been done in the past.\nProvide to the defense any and all evidence related to DNA testing in the case.\nWood responded by stating the investigation into Tylee and JJ\u2019s deaths is ongoing and any evidence in his possession has already been provided to Prior and Means.\n\n\u201CWhen updated or new discoverable reports are received, they will be given over to both defendants on an ongoing basis,\u201D Wood wrote. \u201CSince the investigation\u2019s inception, numerous items of evidentiary value have been collected; many of which are suitable for forensic analysis and testing. The reports reflecting the seizure of these items have been produced to the defense.\u201D\n\nWood referenced one report about the seizure of tools that are taking a long time to test because of COVID-19 delays and backlogs at forensic laboratories.\n\n\u201COn April 12, 2021, the State received the results of DNA analysis of debris found on tools that were seized from Chad Daybell\u2019s property,\u201D Wood said. \u201CThe State also learned that some samples obtained from the examined items were possibly suited for DNA analysis but that those samples were of such size and quantity that the testing process itself would consume the entirety of the sample(s).\u201D\n\nWood said on April 18, he received another report from the state lab \u201Cregarding a possible blood sample from an apartment that would require consumptive testing to test the DNA.\u201D He did not specify which apartment the sample came from, but Lori and her brother, Alex, lived at separate apartments in Rexburg when the children disappeared in September 2019.\n\nThree days after receiving the report about the apartment sample, Wood said he sent the lab results to the defense attorneys along with a letter saying he planned to ask the state lab to perform testing.\n\n\u201CBoth defendants wrote the State and told the State they objected to this without their experts having a chance to review the materials,\u201D Wood wrote. \u201COn (April 22), the State sent the Defense an email informing them that due to their requests, the State would not immediately seek the consumptive testing and asked the Defense to send the State the names of their experts within 14 days. The State offered to facilitate the defense experts\u2019 access to and examination of the sample(s) in question.\u201D\n\nWood said that he is entitled to test evidence \u201Cto achieve a fair and just result\u201D and noted that forensic testing is common.\n\nHe explained:\n\nHe has no objection to the defense experts examining items in evidence within a reasonable timeline established by the court.\nThe prosecution has a certified and accredited forensic laboratory ready and able to perform analysis without cost to either party once the defense examination of the sample(s) and questions have been completed.\nShould defense experts be able to arrange an appropriate protocol for observing the testing procedures agreeable to the state\u2019s experts, the state will agree to those experts observing the testing processes.\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Wood agreed to hold off on any testing that would completely consume evidence until information is received from the state lab. Both parties could then work out an agreement or request that Boyce resolve the issue.",

You can\u0027t see much since the footage is blurred, but you can hear what is said amongst first responders. \n\n\u0022Our detectives are coming out,\u0022 an officer is heard saying in the video. \u0022If you guys are are not transporting him, just leave him be because we have other stuff to do at the house.\u0022 \n\nPolice in Gilbert have already released dozens of pages of heavily redacted reports giving insight into Cox\u0027s death. Investigators believe Cox is tied to the death of Daybell\u2019s two children, 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan. Their bodies were found buried on the Fremont County property of Chad Daybell, Lori\u2019s husband, in June 2020.\n\nEMTs and police were called to Cox\u0027s house where he lived at with his new wife Zulema Pastenes by a 19-year-old stepson. He found Cox lying on the floor of the bathroom gasping for air as vomit came from his mouth. Cox was taken to Banner Gateway Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nWhen officers first got to the scene, they were not exactly sure about why detectives were coming to the house. Paramedics were trying to save Cox\u0027s life as people in the room speculated about how he died\n\n\u0022Just from walking around the house, my assumption would be it\u0027s probably drug-related because of the blowtorches down there,\u0022 an officer says. \u0022Usually people don\u0027t have blowtorches in (inaudible audio).\u0022 \n\nHowever, autopsy and toxicology reports obtained by EastIdahoNews.com in May 2020 show a medical examiner determined Cox died of natural causes. The report indicates Cox died of blood clots wedged into the arteries of his lungs. High blood pressure also contributed to his death.\n\nIdaho court documents show Cox\u2019s phone placed him at the location where the remains of JJ and Tylee were found around the time they disappeared. No one has been charged in the kids\u2019 deaths, but Chad and Lori Daybell are charged with felonies related to the concealment, alteration and destruction of their bodies.",

      "description": "ST. ANTHONY \u2013 A local judge says an out-of-state veteran homicide attorney can join the prosecution team against Chad Daybell.\n\nHowever, that is not yet determined in the case against his wife, Lori Vallow Daybell, due to a previous sealed court order suspending all upcoming hearings. The first 30 minutes of the hearing were in a breakout session, which was likely related to those sealed court orders.\n\nDistrict Judge Steven Boyce decided on Chad\u2019s case to allow Rachel Smith \u2014 a Missouri special prosecutor with over 100 homicide and death penalty cases to her name \u2013 to help Madison County Prosecutor Rob Wood\u2019s team.\n\n\u201CThis is a very complicated case,\u201D Wood told Boyce. \u201CThe amount of discovery as we talked about is very large. There is a lot of information, so we\u2019re seeking to have her help in this case through the Madison County Prosecutors Office through a Special Prosecutor.\u201D\n\nThe judge\u2019s only concerns about the move, which were echoed by Prior, were some housekeeping issues. Namely, that the case is in Fremont County, while Wood is asking for Smith to join the Madison County Prosecutors Office. Boyce was concerned that Fremont County would have to weigh in on the appointment. Woods, however, said he planned to essentially deputize Smith, and Boyce said he was OK with that once the court received a written filing to that effect.\n\nBoyce\u2019s other concern was whether Smith maintains a current law practice in Missouri. Smith, who was present with Wood, testified that she does currently operate a practice, which also satisfied the judge\u2019s concern.\n\nSmith is going to be paid by Madison County. In a letter sent to the Madison County Commissioners and obtained by EastIdahoNews.com, Wood said the enormous amount of work on the case and a comparatively smaller team make it difficult to keep up with the day-to-day work. The commission approved the request.\n\nThe Daybells have pleaded not guilty to felonies related to the alterations, destruction and concealment of the bodies of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan, two of Lori\u2019s children. Investigators found the remains buried in the backyard of Chad\u2019s Salem home in June 2020. The case is currently in Fremont County, where Wood is acting in the role of Special Prosecutor.\n\nNear the end of the hearing, Prior said all his concerns had been satisfied. Mark Means, Lori\u2019s attorney, did not speak during the public portion of the hearing.\n\nThe next hearing in the Daybell case is scheduled for a status conference on April 7.",

The podcast has been ranked No. 1 on Apple charts since it was announced last week.\n\n\u201CMommy Doomsday\u201D takes a closer look at the Daybells and events surrounding the disappearance of JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan, Lori\u2019s children. They were found buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s property in June. The couple is now facing charges of destruction, alteration or concealment of evidence. They have denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201CThis is such a strange and remarkable tale with events which have occurred that people find hard to believe,\u201D Morrison tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CAmong stories to cover, this is one of those that you go, \u2018Well duh, of course you do a podcast on \u201CMommy Doomsday\u201D because it\u2019s just such an unbelievable story.\u0027\u201D\n\nMorrison says the podcast is \u201Cfreeing\u201D in that it allows him to tell the story without worrying about video to match his narration. He also doesn\u2019t need to be concerned about time constraints he faces in television.\n\n\u201COne of the advantages of a podcast is you can let the story breathe. You can go down all the rabbit holes and delve into the mysteries that you simply don\u2019t have time for in a television story,\u201D he says.\n\nMorrison\u2019s previous podcast\n\nThis marks the second original true-crime podcast from Morrison, who previously hosted the No. 1 podcast \u201CThe Thing About Pam,\u201D which was downloaded more than 14 million times since it launched in September 2019 and was listed on Apple\u2019s top 25 most popular new shows of 2019.\n\nThe podcast tells the story of Russ Faria, who came home two days after Christmas in 2011 to find his wife, Betsy, dead. Her brutal murder set off a chain of events that would leave another person dead and expose a diabolical scheme.\n\nThis month, NBC greenlit a series based on the story featured in \u201CThe Thing About Pam.\u201D Two-time Oscar-winning actress Renee Zellweger will star and executive produce the show.\n\n\u201CIt was another story that was just bizarre and strange. Curious things happened and then more curious things happened,\u201D Morrison says. \u201CInteresting that when we made the announcement it was going to be a movie, and Rene Zellweger was going to be in it, all of a sudden the podcast was back in the top 10 again.\u201D\n\nThe first two episodes of \u201CMommy Doomsday,\u201D produced in partnership with Neon Hum, will be available for download and streaming on any podcast platform beginning today. An additional four episodes will debut over the next three weeks.\n\nWatch our entire interview with Morrison in the video player above.",

      "description": "REXBURG \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell did not attend a virtual court hearing on misdemeanor charges in Madison County Monday morning.\n\nWhile the felony charges surrounding Daybell have been in the spotlight, her misdemeanor charges are still pending. The charges came during the search for Daybell\u2019s two children, 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan.\n\nDuring the virtual hearing, Daybell\u2019s attorney, Mark Means, said his client did not want to attend the proceedings that lasted less than five minutes. Means also submitted a waiver to a speedy trial.\n\nMeans, along with Madison County Prosecutor Rob Wood and Magistrate Judge Michelle Mallard, discussed when to schedule a jury trial on the misdemeanor charges. The trial is now set for Aug. 30 to Sept. 3 with a pretrial conference on Aug. 17.\n\nDaybell\u2019s misdemeanor charges consist of resisting or obstructing officers, criminal solicitation to commit a crime and contempt of court.\n\nProsecutors allege that on Nov. 26, 2019, Daybell lied to police about JJ\u2019s whereabouts by saying the child was with her friend, Melanie Gibb, in Arizona. Daybell allegedly asked Gibb to lie to investigators and say JJ was with her.\n\nThe contempt charge stems from Daybell not complying with an order signed by Magistrate Judge Faren Eddins that required her to produce the children to the police or the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare.\n\nOn June 9, 2020, investigators found JJ and Tylee\u2019s remains buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s Salem property. Chad is the fifth husband of Lori and both face felony charges in Fremont County.\n\nYou can find all of the latest Daybell case news here.",

      "description": "REXBURG \u2014 Newly released audio of Lori Vallow Daybell appears to show her justifying the concept of murder using verses of religious scriptures.\n\nThe recording came from October 2018 and shared with EastIdahoNews.com by Annie Cushing, the sister of Daybell\u2019s third ex-husband, Joseph Ryan. The statements about murder were referring to Ryan, who died of an apparent heart attack several months before the recording.\n\nCushing hopes by sharing the audio, police in Phoenix, Arizona, will open an investigation into her brother\u2019s death. Ryan\u2019s death is just one of several oddly timed deaths related to the Daybell case.\n\n\u201CYou think you can\u2019t be shocked anymore by Lori Vallow Daybell, and then you get a recording like this,\u201D Cushing said.\n\nThe 40-minute recording is of an informal religious discussion where Daybell preached about her beliefs to a number of friends. Cushing has not said where she obtained the record, but EastIdahoNews.com can verify the voices of several people at the meeting. At the time of this recording, Daybell was married to Charles Vallow.\n\nThe discussion starts with Daybell talking about how much she loves Jesus Christ and her experience with angels. She talks about Moroni visiting her as an angel. Moroni is an ancient prophet written about in the Book of Mormon. Early Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints accounts describe Moroni returning to earth as an angel.\n\nDaybell also mentions her difficult divorce with Ryan and initiates the discussion about murder.\n\n\u201CI was going to murder him,\u201D Daybell said in the audio. \u201CI was going to kill him like the scriptures say. Like Nephi (another Book of Mormon prophet) killed \u2026 just to stop the pain and to stop him coming after me and to stop him coming after my children.\u201D\n\nDaybell told those at the meeting that Ryan raped her children. She said that during the divorce proceedings, Ryan called her a \u201Clying crazy Mormon.\u201D Daybell said Ryan turned the judges against her and was continuously trying to get custody of their daughter, Tylee Ryan.\n\n\u201CI would go through the scriptures and find all the things,\u201D Daybell said. \u201CIf he comes against you once, if he comes against you twice, if he comes against you three times, then you can kill him. It says it in the scriptures.\u201D\n\nUtah State University Religion Professor Patrick Mason, who specializes in Mormon history, told EastIdahoNews.com that Daybell appears to be referring to a passage in Section 98 of the Doctrine and Covenants, another book of scripture used by Latter-day Saints. Mason said the revelation was given to church founder Joseph Smith in 1833 after early members experienced violent persecution from mobs.\n\n\u201CThe clear message of the revelation is the Saints should not pursue violence,\u201D Mason said. \u201CBut it goes on, and it does lay out a very specific criteria when the Saints could be \u2018justified on fighting back.\u2019 \u2026 To invoke this particular revelation to justify murder even of somebody who has perhaps abused you or treated you poorly in the past, that to me seems well beyond what the revelation actually allows.\u201D\n\nAs the thoughts of killing Ryan ensued, Daybell shared that a wise person told her to attend a Latter-day Saint temple, a sacred place of worship for church members. Daybell had been a longtime member of the faith and went to her local leader to obtain a recommend, which permits members who are deemed spiritually worthy to enter.\n\n\u201CI did not have a murderous heart,\u201D Daybell said. \u201CI just wanted to stop the bleeding and stop the pain. \u2026 I was like, \u2018I\u2019m either going to turn my life to the temple, or I\u2019m going to commit murder.\u0027\u201D\n\nThe recording has some similarities to other documents and videos that have been released about Daybell. In January 2019, Daybell\u2019s fourth husband, Charles Vallow, contacted police in Gilbert, Arizona and told officers that his wife was having a mental breakdown. Vallow told police \u201Cshe just lost touch with reality.\u201D\n\nBody camera footage shows Vallow explained Daybell believed another person had taken over his body and Daybell allegedly told him, \u201CI can murder you now with my powers.\u201D\n\nWhen that video was recorded, Daybell had been married to Vallow for many years. Ryan and Daybell divorced in 2004, but a contentious custody battle continued for years.\n\nRyan died in April 2018. His body was not discovered for about a week. The medical examiner said Ryan died of an apparent heart attack, but Cushing believes foul play may have been involved.\n\nRead more on EastIdahoNews.com",

      "description": "SALEM \u2014 One year ago today, Tammy Daybell died in her Fremont County home, and her family wants to make sure her life is not forgotten.\n\nOn Monday, Tammy\u2019s siblings and parents announced the creation of the Tammy Douglas Daybell Foundation \u201Cto honor her legacy of service and love of literacy.\u201D\n\n\u201CThe mission of the Tammy Douglas Daybell Foundation is to give children the opportunity to love the written word,\u201D according to a statement from the family. \u201CThe Foundation has been established as a nonprofit organization and has been granted 501(c)3 status but is not able to accept donations at this time.\n\nDetails of the foundation will be announced at a later date, but a Facebook page, Twitter and Instagram accounts, along with a website, have been set up for the public to follow developments on the project.\n\nFremont County Sheriff deputies were called to Tammy and Chad Daybell\u2019s home Oct. 19, 2019. Chad said Tammy went to bed coughing and he discovered she had died in her sleep. The 49-year-old mother of five had been in good health and was training for a race.\n\nTammy had visited with her siblings and parents two weeks earlier in Springville, Utah, and showed no sign of sickness.\n\nWithin weeks of her death, Chad married Lori Vallow Daybell, and a massive investigation involving multiple law enforcement agencies was launched into her death, along with the death of Lori\u2019s former husband, Charles Vallow, and her two missing children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan.\n\nTammy\u2019s body was exhumed in December and the Idaho Attorney General\u2019s Office is investigating Chad and Lori for conspiracy, attempted murder and murder in connection to the death. Scott Graf, a spokesman for the office, tells EastIdahoNews.com the investigation is ongoing. Autopsy results have not been released.\n\nTammy was the librarian at Central Elementary School in Sugar City and had also worked at Madison Middle School. She loved reading and serving others.\n\n\u201CTammy\u2019s true focus throughout her life was her family, from serving a delicious dinner each Sunday to remembering every birthday and holiday with gifts,\u201D her obituary reads. \u201CShe also loved all sorts of animals, but she especially loved Indian runner ducks. She also raised pigeons, chickens, cats and rabbits, knowing each one by name. She loved gardening, cooking and playing games with the family. Her laugh will be remembered and cherished.\u201D",

The media is being asked to remain in a staging area. Nobody has been taken into custody and police tell EastIdahoNews.com they will be on the scene for hours.\n\nFBI spokeswoman Sandra Barker confirms the agency\u2019s Evidence Response Team is assisting Madison County with the execution of a search warrant.\n\nThis is the second major search performed at the Daybell home. Law enforcement removed 43 items from the house during a multi-agency raid on Jan. 3. Officers searched a shed and used metal detectors, probes and rakes to go over several portions of the yard.\n\nTammy Daybell, Chad\u2019s first wife, died suddenly at the Salem home in October. Chad and his new wife, Lori Vallow Daybell, are being investigated by the Idaho Attorney General\u2019s Office for conspiracy, attempted murder and murder in connection to the death. Lori Daybell\u2019s two children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan, have been missing since September, and Lori is in the Madison County Jail on two counts of desertion and nonsupport of a dependent child.\n\nEastIdahoNews.com reporter Eric Grossarth is at the scene.

In this story, we will refer to her as Melissa Cook. Madison County Jail officials confirm Cook was incarcerated on a parole violation at the time Daybell was booked. Cook was later sent to another correctional facility until she was recently released from custody.\n\nCook visited with EastIdahoNews.com for two hours last week and provided notes she kept while behind bars in Madison County. The notes detail conversations Cook allegedly had with Daybell.\n\nDuring the time they were both incarcerated, Daybell spoke with her new husband, Chad Daybell, and her son, Colby Ryan. Cook overheard parts of those conversations from her adjacent cell.\n\nRead the entire story at EastIdahoNews.com",

      "description": "ST. ANTHONY -- Chad Daybell pleaded not guilty to four felony charges Friday morning as his case advances to a jury trial set to begin in January.\n\nDaybell appeared before District Court Judge Steven Boyce who read a summary of Daybell\u0027s charges, including two felony counts of conspiracy to commit destruction, alteration or concealment of evidence, and two felony counts of destruction, alteration or concealment of evidence.\n\nSeated next to his attorney, John Prior, Daybell appeared via Zoom from the Fremont County Jail. He was dressed in a white shirt and red tie and showed little emotion during the 10-minute hearing. Prior entered the not guilty plea on behalf of Daybell.\n\n\u0022By pleading not guilty you will maintain all your constitutional rights in this case,\u0022 Boyce said. \u0022Among those rights, you have the right to be presumed innocent. The presumption of innocence is a real and important right that lies at the foundation of our criminal justice system.\u0022\n\nBoyce further explained that unless Daybell pleads guilty at a later date or the prosecutor proves to a jury the charges against him beyond a reasonable doubt, the presumption of innocence remains. \n\nBoyce asked Madison County Prosecuting Attorney Rob Wood, a special attorney appointed to the case, how long would be needed for a jury trial. Wood suggested three weeks and Prior agreed.\n\nThe jury trial is scheduled to run from Jan. 11 to 29, in Fremont County. A pretrial conference is set for Dec. 10.\n\nDaybell is the husband of Lori Vallow Daybell, the mother of 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan. The bodies of the children were found in June buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s property.\n\nSince his arrest on June 9, Daybell has been held in the Fremont County Jail on $1 million bail. Earlier this month, he sat in court for his preliminary hearing in which investigators, friends and other witnesses testified. \n\nLori Daybell is also charged in Fremont County with two felony counts of conspiracy to commit destruction, alteration, or concealment of evidence. She is scheduled to be arraigned on Sept. 10 before District Judge Dane H. Watkins Jr. \n\nPrior now has 60 days to file a motion if he wants to move the trial to another venue. If convicted of all charges, Daybell could face up to 20 years in prison and $40,000 in fines.",

      "description": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 It\u2019s no secret FBI agents have been actively assisting local law enforcement in the Chad and Lori Daybell criminal investigations.\n\nAgents in Idaho and from the Salt Lake City division are involved and a large part of the case is being worked on from the Intermountain West Regional Computer Forensic Laboratory (RCFL).\n\nWhen investigators seized 43 items from Chad Daybell\u2019s Fremont County home in January, computers, cell phones and other devices were sent to the RCFL where Cheney Eng-Tow is the lab director and a supervisory special agent for the FBI.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019re essentially a digital forensic task force,\u201D Eng-Tow tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CWe\u2019re made up of FBI and state and local officers who are assigned here by their agencies. Our role is to provide digital forensic services to all law enforcement agencies in Utah, Montana and Idaho.\u201D\n\nThe Daybell case is still very active, so Eng-Tow can\u2019t speak to it specifically but he was able to explain what the 12 employees in the RCFL do when computers, laptops, phones, drones, vehicles, watches and other electronics come in.\n\n\u201CIf there is stuff on there that\u2019s going to help prosecute somebody, we want to find it. If there\u2019s not anything on there, that\u2019s fine as well but at least the case agent knows for sure what\u2019s on there,\u201D Eng-Tow says.\n\nAnalyzing computers\n\nWhen a computer is checked into the RCFL for evidence, a forensic examiner removes the hard drive and images, or duplicates, it on a separate hard drive. The original is put back into the computer and left alone.\n\n\u201CThe computer goes back in the evidence room and we now just work on the copy that we made,\u201D Eng-Tow explains. \u201CAfter you\u2019ve taken an image of the hard drive, you can hash it.\u201D\n\nA hash value is a mathematical algorithm generated from a string of text. Eng-Tow compares it to a \u201Cdigital fingerprint\u201D where every piece of data is unique.\n\nSome computers have millions of files and terabytes of information, but with the help of software, examiners are able to scour the duplicate hard drive for anything that might be helpful to the case. It can takes hours, weeks or even months to collect the necessary information.\n\n\u201CAfter we\u2019ve done our examination, we then run a hash value again which should match the original one,\u201D Eng-Tow says. \u201CIf (the case) goes to court, we can then say that hash value at the end matched the one at the beginning which matched the original hard drive. Therefore, we can say that any evidence we pulled out of there was on there from the beginning \u2013 we didn\u2019t touch or add anything to it.\u201D\n\nAnalyzing cell phones\n\nWorking on cell phones are a little different. You can\u2019t image, or duplicate, a phone so examiners use software and programs developed by the FBI to conduct their searches.\n\nThe challenge can come when the phone has a password or PIN that can\u2019t be cracked.\n\n\u201CSometimes when you\u2019re trying to break these passwords, you\u2019re trying millions of combinations a second. We\u2019ve had them run for months and not be successful,\u201D Eng-Tow says. \u201CSometimes we get in, sometimes we don\u2019t. If you let it run long enough, hopefully, you\u2019ll get in.\u201D\n\nOften the case agent assigned to the case might obtain password information from other evidence, like hand-written journals. Eng-Tow says sometimes examiners find passwords for phones stored on computers or vice versa.\n\nIf a phone or encrypted computer is particularly difficult to crack, it could be sent to FBI headquarters in Quantico, Virginia where enhanced programs and tools are available.\n\nHow the RCFL works\n\nWhen evidence is brought to the RCFL, it is checked in and a \u201Cchain of custody\u201D is generated. That means any time anybody looks at it or checks it out, a record is made.\n\nThe forensic examiners will gather information for the case agent and local law enforcement. Any law enforcement agency in Utah, Montana and Idaho can submit digital evidence to the RCFL and the FBI covers the costs. That can be beneficial to small departments that don\u2019t have a trained professional or the budget to analyze electronic evidence.\n\nThere are 16 other Regional Computer Forensic Laboratories across the country and they only handle police investigations.\n\nThe complete story can be found here: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2020/08/inside-the-fbi-lab-that-processed-daybells-devices-and-other-electronic-evidence/",

      "description": "REXBURG \u2014 Melanie Gibb says testifying during Chad Daybell\u2019s preliminary hearing this week \u201Cwas quite the experience\u201D but her favorite part was meeting Larry and Kay Woodcock, the grandparents of Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow.\n\nGibb was a close friend of Daybell and his wife, Lori Vallow Daybell. Gibb has known for months that she would be a key witness during court proceedings as her friends face charges after JJ and his sister, Tylee Ryan, were found buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s property June 9.\n\n\u201COverall I\u2019m grateful to be able to share the information and knowledge that I have,\u201D Gibb tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CIt\u2019s hard to talk about those things knowing the whole world is watching you.\u201D\n\nA dramatic moment during Gibb\u2019s testimony came when Madison County Prosecuting Attorney Rob Wood played a 21-minute phone call from Dec. 8, 2019. Gibb confronted Chad and Lori about JJ, lies they allegedly told police and the fact they had been \u201Cdeceived\u201D and were on a dangerous path.\n\nLISTEN: Melanie Gibb confronts Lori and Chad Daybell in phone call\n\n\u201CI knew after many people heard that, they would understand Chad and Lori and my relationship with them a little bit better,\u201D Gibb says. \u201CI\u2019m really grateful that got to come out. I knew it would help so I was happy to share it.\u201D\n\nGibb has received some criticism since first speaking publicly about the case in May. During a lengthy interview with EastIdahoNews.com at the time, she said Chad and Lori were good people and expressed loved for them.\n\nWeeks later, the remains of JJ and Tylee were discovered and Chad was arrested. The couple had told Gibb last year that the children had become \u201Czombies\u201D along with Lori\u2019s former husband, Charles Vallow. He was shot and killed by Lori\u2019s brother, Alex Cox, on July 11, 2019. Cox died of natural causes in December, according to the Maricopa County Medical Examiner.\n\n\u201CChad and Lori never talked about killing anyone. They would always talk about praying and hoping spirits (of zombies) would leave the bodies,\u201D Gibb explains. \u201CShe was also predicting dates about things that were going to happen and they just never happened. It seemed like there was a prediction every month or every week, and they didn\u2019t happen. I didn\u2019t get a sense that any of the things she said would happen so I didn\u2019t take a lot of it too seriously.\u201D\n\nOne of those predictions included a major worldwide event happening this month. While the couple reportedly believed the world would end July 22, 2020, Gibb says she had never heard anything from about that date.\n\n\u201CTheir biggest date was August,\u201D she says. \u201CI don\u2019t think they thought the world was necessarily going to come to an end but it would be a sign of a new transition or maybe things would start happening after that time.\u201D\n\nWhile Gibb had spoken to the Woodcocks on the phone, she had never met them until this week. They exchanged kind words Tuesday morning before the preliminary hearing and Gibb told Kay Woodcock that she loved her.\n\nFIND COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE DAYBELL CASE HERE\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, Magistrate Judge Faren Eddins said Chad Daybell likely committed two felony counts of conspiracy to commit destruction, alteration or concealment of evidence, and two felony counts of destruction, alteration or concealment of evidence. His case now advances to District Court and he will be arraigned Aug. 21.\n\nLori faces two felony charges of conspiracy to commit destruction, alteration or concealment of evidence and remains in the Madison County Jail on $1 million bail. Her preliminary hearing is scheduled for Aug. 10 and 11.\n\nGibb says she hopes others who follow the teachings of her former friends will realize they are wrong. The experiences of the past year have strengthened her faith, she says, and she has a message for Chad and Lori.\n\n\u201CI hope that they can realize this is pure evil. There\u2019s nothing good. The whole goal for them was to be together and they\u2019re not,\u201D Gibb says. \u201CAll the things that they thought were going to happen, their predicted revelations \u2013 can you not see that nothing happened the way you thought they would happen?\u2026At some point, you\u2019re going to have to come to the realization that you can\u2019t live in this pretend bubble. It has to pop eventually because they\u2019re not going to come out of jail. They\u2019re going to be there the rest of their lives.\u201D\n\nWatch our entire conversation with Gibb in the video player above.",

      "description": "ST. ANTHONY \u2014 Chad Daybell will appear before a judge and hear evidence about the crimes he allegedly committed for the first time in person Monday.\n\nA preliminary hearing will begin at 9 a.m. in the Fremont County Courthouse. Daybell is charged with two felony counts of conspiracy to commit destruction, alteration or concealment of evidence and two felony counts of destruction, alteration or concealment of evidence.\n\nHe was arrested June 9 after the remains of Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan were found buried on his property. Since then, he has appeared for court hearings from the Fremont County Jail via Zoom but on Monday, he and his attorney, John Prior, will go before Magistrate Judge Faren Eddins in a courtroom while Madison County Prosecuting Attorney Rob Wood calls witnesses and presents evidence. Wood has been appointed as a special prosecutor in the case.\n\n\u201CA preliminary hearing is where a judge in open court makes a determination whether there\u2019s probable cause. More specifically, the judge determines whether a crime was committed and whether the defendant probably committed that crime,\u201D says Bonneville County Prosecuting Attorney Danny Clark.\n\nFIND THE LATEST NEWS ON THE DAYBELL CASES HERE\n\nClark is not associated with the Daybell cases but agreed to speak to EastIdahoNews.com to explain how court proceedings generally work. He says once a criminal complaint is filed and a defendant is in custody, a preliminary hearing is usually held within 14 days. In big cases, that timeframe can be extended.\n\nDuring Daybell\u2019s hearing, Wood will need to convince Eddins that Daybell likely committed the crimes he\u2019s accused of. Wood has subpoenaed several people to testify, including FBI Special Agent Benjamin Dean, FBI Special Agent Steven Daniels, FBI Special Agent Gary Lyu and Rylene Nowlin, an employee with Idaho State Police Forensic Services.\n\nClick here for the full story: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2020/07/whats-expected-to-happen-at-chad-daybells-preliminary-hearing/",

      "description": "REXBURG \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s bail was lowered on three Madison County misdemeanor charges and a jury trial has been scheduled for the alleged crimes early next year.\n\nDaybell appeared with her attorney, Mark Means, via Zoom in front of Magistrate Judge Michelle Mallard Friday morning for a pre-trial conference. She is charged with resisting or obstructing officers, criminal solicitation to commit a crime and contempt of court.\n\nShe is also charged in Fremont County with two felony counts of conspiracy to destroy, alter, or conceal evidence. The hearing Friday is separate from the Fremont case, where bail remains at $1 million.\n\nDaybell was originally charged in Madison County with two felony counts of desertion and nonsupport of children. Bond was set at $1 million but those charges were dropped July 2, so Means argued the amount should be lowered.\n\n\u201CWe think ultimately the $1 million isn\u2019t reflective of the current charges and we ask that the court reduce it to $100,000,\u201D Means said. \u201CMy client has been a model inmate and these charges are not of a violent nature. There is no previous criminal record regarding my client in any jurisdiction that we know of.\u201D\n\nMeans noted that Daybell\u2019s access to funds are \u201Cextremely limited\u201D and explained the maximum penalty she could face if convicted of the misdemeanors would be two years in jail and a $2,500 fine.\n\nMadison County Prosecuting Attorney Rob Wood requested if Mallard does reduce bond that it be no lower than $250,000. While Daybell only faces misdemeanors in Madison County, Wood said they tie directly to the fact that she tried to conceal the location of her children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan. Their remains were discovered buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s property June 9.\n\n\u201CWhen the defendant obstructed the investigation into the safety and welfare of JJ Vallow, she was hiding the location of her dead child,\u201D Wood said. \u201CWhen she refused to comply with a lawful order to produce her children, she did so in an effort to conceal the deaths of her minor children all while telling family and friends that they were fine.\u201D\n\nMallard decided to decrease bond to $50,000 on each charge totaling $150,000. She noted that Daybell would still need to post $1 million in Fremont County to get out of jail. Fremont does not have a women\u2019s facility, so all female inmates from both jurisdictions are housed in Madison County.\n\n\u201CIf Ms. Daybell does post bond, I\u2019m adding an additional condition to her release that she has no contact whatsoever with her alleged co-conspirator (Chad Daybell) in the Fremont County case,\u201D Mallard said.\n\nA jury trial on the three charges was scheduled for Jan. 25-29, 2021. A preliminary hearing on the Fremont County charges is set for Aug. 10 and 11.\n\nClick here for the latest news on the Daybell case.",

      "description": "ST. ANTHONY \u2014 Court documents released Tuesday detail how police say Lori Vallow Daybell conspired to conceal evidence in the deaths of her children and the horrific manner in which their bodies were found in Chad Daybell\u2019s backyard.\n\nLori was charged late Monday with two felony counts of conspiracy to commit destruction, alteration or concealment of evidence. A 16-page affidavit of probable cause contains information by detectives that led them to file charges. Police say she conspired with Chad, her husband, who is facing two felony counts of concealment or destruction of evidence.\n\nOn June 9, investigators found Lori\u2019s children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan, had been buried on Chad\u2019s property.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST ON THE DAYBELL CASE\n\nIn the documents, Rexburg Police detective Lt. Ron Ball notes that law enforcement originally thought Tylee was 17 when she disappeared in September. She was last seen at Yellowstone National Park on Sept. 8, 2019 \u2013 two weeks before her birthday on Sept. 24.\n\n\u201CLaw enforcement has stated that Tylee was 17 at the time she went missing because we were not aware she was missing until several months after her 17th birthday,\u201D Ball wrote in the affidavit. \u201CWe now have reason to believe she was killed before her 17th birthday.\u201D\n\nPolice note that based on cell phone records and GPS data, Lori\u2019s brother Alex Cox likely played a role in disposing of Tylee\u2019s body in Chad Daybell\u2019s backyard on Sept. 9. (Cox has since died of what a medical examiner says was natural causes.) Her remains, along with JJ\u2019s, were found as police executed a search warrant. Ball witnessed autopsies performed on each child.\n\nThe complete story can be found here: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2020/06/lori-daybell-lied-and-conspired-to-conceal-the-deaths-of-her-children-documents-allege/",

      "description": "SALEM \u2014 Rexburg Police executed a search warrant at Chad Daybell\u2019s home Monday afternoon.\n\nOfficers in marked and unmarked vehicles arrived around 1:15 p.m. and showed some paperwork to Daybell\u2019s son-in-law, who has been living at the home with his family, witnesses say. Police went into the house, exterior buildings on the property and were seen in the backyard with cameras. They left around 2:50 p.m. It\u2019s unknown what officers were looking for, and Madison County Prosecuting Attorney Rob Wood declined to comment on the warrant.\n\nThe scene Monday is dramatically different than when a search warrant was served June 9 at the same house. Dozens of officers were on the scene and roads were closed for two days as Daybell\u2019s property was excavated. Police discovered the remains of Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan during their search.\n\nThe fact that Rexburg police are at the house means the warrant is likely related to the children, and not the death of Chad Daybell\u2019s wife, Tammy Daybell. The Attorney General\u2019s Office and Fremont County Sheriff\u2019s Office are investigating her death. Fremont County Sheriff\u2019s deputies were assisting Rexburg Police Monday.\n\nChad Daybell was arrested June 9 and charged with two felony counts of destruction, alteration or concealment of evidence. The children\u2019s mother, Lori Vallow Daybell, is charged with desertion of children and three misdemeanors. Both remain in jail on $1 million bail.",

      "title": "A closer look at two pivotal months in the Daybell investigation",
      "description": "REXBURG \u2014 A lot happened in the Daybell investigation over the course of eight weeks last fall.\n\nCrucial events occurred in eastern Idaho during September and October that are key points in the investigation against Chad and Lori Daybell. Chad was arrested June 9 on two felony counts of destruction, alteration or concealment of evidence. Lori is charged with desertion of children and three misdemeanors.\n\nBased on court documents, interviews, previous reports and other sources, here\u2019s a closer look at what led up to where we are today.\n\nSEPTEMBER 1 OR 2 \u2014 Lori Vallow moves into a townhouse on Pioneer Road in Rexburg with her brother, Alex Cox, and children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan. Neighbors told police they helped the family move in and over the next few weeks, their son played with JJ multiple times.\n\nAlex eventually moved into his own unit at the same complex.\n\nSEPTEMBER 8 \u2014 Lori, Alex, JJ and Tylee go to Yellowstone National Park. Photos taken at the park are the last piece of evidence police can find showing Tylee with Lori.\n\nCourt documents show Alex drove everyone in his silver pickup. His phone exits the west entrance of Yellowstone at 6:40 p.m. and is tracked at Buckaroo\u2019s BBQ Grill in West Yellowstone from 6:45 p.m. \u2013 7:02 p.m. Alex returns to Rexburg at 8:37 p.m. and his phone is at Lori\u2019s townhouse until 9:35 p.m. He goes to Maverik and returns to Lori\u2019s house from 10:44 p.m. until 11:15 p.m. At 11:44 p.m., he is located at his house.\n\nSEPTEMBER 9 \u2014 Court documents say Alex\u2019s phone was at Lori\u2019s apartment, where the kids were staying, from 2:42 a.m. until 3:37 a.m. Detectives indicate this is significant because it\u2019s the middle of the night and the only time in September he appears to go to Lori\u2019s house between midnight and 6 a.m.\n\nAlex goes home at 4:37 a.m. and stays there until 8:59 a.m. Twenty-two minutes later, he is located at Chad Daybell\u2019s property. At 9:21 a.m., a GPS data point places him at the east end of the barn on Chad\u2019s land.\n\nAlex appears to stay at the home for over two hours. Then, at 11:52 a.m., he is located at Del Taco in Rexburg.\n\nOne minute later, Chad texts his wife, Tammy, who is at work. He says he\u2019s shot a raccoon and buried it in their pet cemetery. He tells his wife he\u2019s going to write at BYU. Tammy responds at 2:47 p.m., \u201CGood for you.\u201D To which Chad replies, \u201CI\u2019m back home now.\u201D\n\nSEPTEMBER 18 \u2014 A babysitter meets Lori and JJ. She tells police she understood her employment would be ongoing.\n\nSEPTEMBER 19 \u2014 The babysitter watches JJ. Lori\u2019s friends, Melanie Gibb and David Warwick, arrive from Arizona. Lori immediately tells Melanie that JJ has become a zombie.\n\nSEPTEMBER 22 \u2014 Melanie and David tell police they saw JJ late that night as Alex was carrying him to his apartment. Alex later returned and JJ appeared to be asleep on his shoulder.\n\nSEPTEMBER 23 \u2014 David wakes up and asks Lori where JJ is between 8 and 9 a.m. Lori tells David and Melanie that JJ had been acting like a zombie and that Alex came to take him.\n\nDuring their weekend stay, Lori and Melanie discuss how Lori will be taking JJ to stay with Kay Woodcock, his grandmother, so Lori and Chad can complete their mission.\n\nDavid and Melanie leave Rexburg and that day, JJ has an unexcused absence from Kennedy Elementary School.\n\nAt 9:55 a.m., the GPS on Alex\u2019s cell phone shows him at the pond on Chad Daybell\u2019s property. He\u2019s there until 10:12 a.m.\n\nThis is one of four visits Alex makes to Chad\u2019s house in September \u2013 he stays for 12 minutes on Sept 6, 2.5 hours on Sept. 9, 17 minutes on Sept 23 and around 17 minutes on September 25.\n\nSEPTEMBER 24 \u2014 Lori contacts the babysitter and says JJ has gone to stay with his grandmother for several weeks and her services are no longer needed. Lori also calls Kennedy Elementary and says she would now be homeschooling JJ.\n\nOCTOBER 1 \u2014 Lori visits Self Storage Plus in Rexburg and signs an agreement to rent a unit using the name Lori Ryan. She, Alex and a man believed to be Chad Daybell visit the storage locker eight more times in October and once in November.\n\nOCTOBER 2 \u2014 Lori and a who is likely Chad drop off a tire and what appears to be a removable car seat at the storage unit.\n\nIn Arizona, Brandon Boudreaux, the ex-husband of Lori\u2019s niece, Melani Pawlowski, is shot at while driving home from the gym. A private investigator believes the shooter was Alex and he was driving a Jeep registered to Charles Vallow.\n\nAlso on this day, a size 4 Sterling Silver Southwestern Style Malachite Gemstone is ordered on Charles Vallow\u2019s Amazon account and shipped to Lori\u2019s Rexburg home. It\u2019s the same ring spotted in her wedding photos weeks later.\n\nRead and watch the entire story at EastIdahoNews.com.",

      "description": "REXBURG \u2014 Court documents released Friday evening detail the horrific manner in which Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan were found in Chad Daybell\u2019s backyard. JJ was wrapped in plastic and bound by duct tape while Tylee was dismembered and burned.\n\nThe information is contained in an 11-page affidavit of probable cause that was unsealed by Magistrate Judge Faren Eddins Friday. The documents are in relation to Chad Daybell, who is charged with two felony counts of concealment or destruction of evidence. He was arrested June 9 after investigators excavated a section of his Salem property and discovered the remains of Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan.\n\nWhat happened to Tylee\n\nTylee was last seen Sept. 8, 2019 on a trip to Yellowstone National Park with her mother, Lori Vallow Daybell, uncle, Alex Cox, and brother JJ.\n\nMonths earlier, in the spring, Lori told her friend, Melanie Gibb, that Tylee had become a zombie, meaning his spirit had left his body and he had become \u201Cdark.\u201D\n\n\u201CGibb was on the phone with Lori and heard Lori call Tylee a zombie to which Tylee responded \u2018not me, mom.\u2019 This arose out of Lori requiring Tylee to babysit JJ and Tylee did not want to. Lori Vallow also told Gibb that Tylee had turned into a zombie when she was 12 or 13, which was approximately the same time Tylee had become \u2018difficult\u2019 to deal with,\u201D the affidavit says.\n\nGibb traveled from Arizona to Rexburg with her boyfriend, David Warwick, from Sept. 19 through Sept. 23. They never saw Tylee and Lori said she was attending school at Brigham Young University-Idaho.\n\nLori\u2019s brother, Alex Cox, had a townhouse in the same complex as his sister. Investigators obtained Cox\u2019s cell phone records and compared his activities on Sept. 9 with other days the same month.\n\n\u201COn Monday, September 9, from 12 a.m. and 12:44 a.m., Cox\u2019s phone was located at his apartment (107.) However, at 2:42 a.m. to 3:37 a.m., Cox is located again at Lori\u2019s Apartment (175) where Lori lived with Tylee and JJ. This is significant, not only because he is there in the middle of the night, but also because this is the only time in September he appears to go over to Lori\u2019s between midnight and 6 am,\u201D the probable cause says.\n\nAlex returned to his apartment at 4:37 a.m. and then, at 9:21 a.m., he was located at Chad Daybell\u2019s property. The GPS datapoint placed him near the east end of the barn, according to court records, and he was still at the property at 10:30 a.m.\n\n\u201CAt 10:47 a.m., his phone shows a hit at the City of St. Anthony. At this time, we are unable to tell if he was actually inside the city limits of St. Anthony\u2026or if this was a cell tower ping on his phone while he was still at the Daybell residence,\u201D Lt. Ball wrote. \u201CAt 10:57 to 11:39 Cox is located at the Daybell property. At 11:52 to 12:02 he was at Dell Taco in Rexburg. He appears to spend most of the rest of the day in his apartment.\u201D\n\nThat same day, the FBI found the following text message conversation between Chad and his wife Tammy Daybell:\n\nChad to Tammy at 11:53 a.m.: Well, I\u2019ve had an interesting morning! I felt I should burn all of the limb debris by the fire pit before it got too soaked by the coming storms. While I did so, I spotted a big raccoon along the fence. I hurried and got my gun, and he was still walking along. I got close enough that one shot did the trick. He is now in our pet cemetery. Fun times!\n\nChad to Tammy at 11:56 a.m.: Gonna shower now and then go write for a while at BYU. Love you!\n\nTammy to Chad at 2:47 p.m.: Good for you!\n\nChad to Tammy at 2:48 pm: I\u2019m back home now\n\nLt. Ball wrote the following about the exchange:\n\n\u201CI found the text suspicious because raccoons are normally nocturnal animals and are not regularly out during the day,\u201D he said. \u201CIt should be noted that from interviewing neighbors of Chad Daybell, we are aware that in mid-July of 2019, Garth Daybell, Chad\u2019s son, told their neighbors that Chad had shot a raccoon out of a tree on their property during the day. Garth told (a neighbor) about the raccoon in response to a question from Matt about hearing a gunshot. (Neighbors) informed me that the fire pit in the back of the Daybell property was hardly ever used until the last few months.\u201D\n\n\nRead the entire story at EastIdahoNews.com",

While there, Vallow said he took Daybell\u2019s keys, phone and wallet.\n\nVallow said a hotel key in her wallet helped him find her and he wanted to get Daybell picked up on a court order for her to receive a mental health examination.\n\nAn officer told Vallow they could not go into the hotel and check on Daybell if employees did not want them to. She said a sergeant with proper paperwork would need to come to the hotel and have Daybell admitted for a psychological evaluation.\n\n\u201CI don\u2019t want her hurt.

      "description": "IDAHO FALLS \u2014 An author who worked closely with Chad Daybell warned him three years ago that his teachings \u201Cwill lead to death and sorrow.\u201D\n\nSuzanne Freeman was one of the first writers to have her work published by Spring Creek Book Company, which Daybell launched in 2004. Over the next ten years, she partnered with him on three projects but in 2014, she felt uncomfortable with the direction his business was moving and new authors he was working with.\n\n\u201CHe started publishing non-Mormon doctrine stories \u2013 people\u2019s different experiences and stuff, and I just told him there\u2019s something that\u2019s not quite right,\u201D Freeman told EastIdahoNews.com earlier this month. \u201CPlus, we were working on a book of mine together to take out of the LDS stuff, and I was kind of surprised by that because he was an LDS author.\u201D\n\nRELATED | Author who worked with Chad Daybell says he\u2019s been deceived and needs to \u2018do the right thing\u2019\n\nFreeman and Chad parted ways, but she wanted the publishing rights to her book back. On June 2, 2017, she sent him an email making the request with a stern warning:\n\nHi Chad,\n\nI was wondering if it was at all possible for you to give me the rights of the books. I understand that you are busy but I have paid you off last fall and I have not seen any royalties since last year.\n\nI have had a deep respect for you and have thought that you were following the spirit but in the past few years I think that deception has crept in.\n\nI do not agree with what you are publishing. I have come to the understanding that what you are publishing is false.\n\nI understand that you don\u2019t agree and you might just think I am being spiteful or jealous in some way. That is further from the truth, but in the end, truth will prevail and the truth of all things will be shown to those who are true and faithful.\n\nI know without a shadow of a doubt what you are preaching will not lead to happiness. It will lead to death and sorrow.\n\nDaybell responded two days later, saying he was sorry Freeman had \u201Cbitter feelings\u201D toward him and agreed to return her publishing rights. The two communicated via email for several months but Freeman said she never got the rights back.\n\nFreeman provided the email chain to EastIdahoNews.com with some personal information and details redacted. She forgot about the messages until she went back to her email archive this week.\n\n\u201CI kept the emails because I wanted proof that he said he would give them (the publishing rights) to me and when I read through it\u2026it was just plain old eery. I just don\u2019t know what to make of it honestly,\u201D she tells EastIdahoNews.com.\n\nFreeman says when she told Chad his teachings would result in \u201Cdeath and sorrow,\u201D she was referring to his predictions about the end-of-times. She was particularly bothered about his idea that a \u201Ccall-out\u201D would happen where righteous members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with food storage and temple recommend would gather at Church-owned camps and prepare for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.\n\nFind the entire story here: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2020/06/author-warned-chad-daybell-3-years-ago-his-teachings-would-lead-to-death-and-sorrow-according-to-email/",

      "description": "SALEM \u2014 Now that remains found in Chad Daybell\u2019s backyard have been identified as Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan, investigators are working to determine how the children died and how they ended up buried on the property.\n\nAutopsies performed by the state medical examiner\u2019s office confirmed the children\u2019s identities, and Madison County Prosecuting Attorney Rob Wood has said one body was concealed in a \u201Cparticularly egregious\u201D manner.\n\nJennifer Shen, a forensic psychology professor at Alliant University, has served as the crime laboratory director for the San Diego Police Department for years. She has been following the Daybell case closely and says investigative work done at a burial site is \u201Ca meticulous operation.\u201D\n\n\u201CThe bodies are generally a wealth of information, so to start with, you\u2019re at the gravesite where you have to recover the bodies in a way that you will make sure you maximize the gain of any evidence,\u201D Shen tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CYou need to go through the gravesite scoopful by scoopful of dirt to make sure there\u2019s nothing you miss.\u201D\n\nDetectives will look for any clues at the burial site, such as plastic bags, gloves, fibers, hair or debris, that could lead them to suspects. Shen explains victims are sometimes identified by the clothing or jewelry they are wearing, and dental records are often used for confirmation.\n\nDaybell was arrested Tuesday after authorities excavated a section of his Salem property and discovered the remains. He is in the Fremont County Jail on $1 million bail charged with two felony counts of concealment or destruction of evidence.\n\nFrom the EastIdahoNews.com helicopter, we noticed a police dog on Daybell\u2019s land as police executed a search warrant. It\u2019s likely the animal helped to find the remains, Shen said.\n\n\u201CIf you have a fairly large property and you have cadaver dogs, those dogs can narrow down where the bodies are very quickly,\u201D she says.\n\nLaw enforcement removed 43 items from Daybell\u2019s home during a multi-agency raid in January. Computers, cell phones, journals, documents and medications were sent to forensic experts for examination. Several feet of snow covered the frozen ground, and no major digs were performed on the property at the time.\n\n\u201CThe investigators on this case have to lay out a very meticulous case for a search warrant. They have to be able to convince a judge that they have enough probable cause to go onto someone\u2019s property and start digging in their backyard, and that\u2019s not easy to do. It shouldn\u2019t be easy to do,\u201D Shen says.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST NEWS ON THE DAYBELL CASE\n\nIt\u2019s likely Daybell and his wife, Lori Vallow Daybell, will face additional charges in connection to the deaths of JJ and Tylee.\n\nWhile the discovery of the remains does bring some closure, other questions remain about aspects of cases tied to Chad and Lori. The Idaho attorney general is investigating both of them for conspiracy, attempted murder and murder in connection to Tammy Daybell, Chad\u2019s first wife. Fremont County Sheriff Len Humphries says her autopsy results have not been finalized.\n\n\u201CThey might be looking for poisons or toxins of some sort. That can take a long time,\u201D Shen says. \u201CThe more complex the poisons or toxins you might be looking for or the body chemistry you might be trying to understand, the longer it takes. They\u2019re not quick tests you can do immediately \u2013 they take longer.\u201D\n\nShen stresses that investigations like these are complex, difficult and time-consuming. Although crimes may be solved within an hour on television, real cases cannot be hurried, and patience is necessary.\n\n\u201CPeople\u2019s lives are at stake. That can\u2019t be rushed. It will take a while and it may be frustrating to wait, but that has to happen,\u201D she says.",

      "description": "IDAHO FALLS -- As the sun set over eastern Idaho Friday night, hundreds of people gathered in a field to remember Joshua \u0022JJ\u0022 Vallow and Tylee Ryan.\n\nA candlelight vigil was held near Soda Tsunami in honor of the two children whose remains were found this week buried in property belonging to Chad Daybell. JJ and Tylee had been missing since September and their mother, Lori Vallow Daybell, refused to tell authorities where they were located.\n\nFamilies as far away as Arizona attended the vigil. April Raymond was friends with Lori in Hawaii and made drove up from Utah with family members to pay her respects.\n\n\u0022I\u0027m glad we have some answers but I\u0027m waiting for a lot more,\u0022 Raymond told EastIdahoNews.com. \u0022We really wanted to be here. It was important for me to have an opportunity to remember Tylee and JJ the way that we would like to.\u0022\n\nTimanee Olsen, who does not know anyone in JJ or Tylee\u0027s families, organized the event, which included poetry, music, and prayer. Many in attendance wiped tears from their eyes as Melissa Padigimus sang \u0027In the Arms of an Angel\u0027 by Sarah McLachlan.\n\n\u0022Everybody\u0027s feeling the devastation and heartache,\u0022 Olsen said. \u0022I think it was one of those things that somebody needed to do it and I happened to be one of the people that was able to make it happen.\u0022\n\nAfter everyone lit a candle, a moment of silence was held for the children. Attendees wrote messages on index cards that will be delivered to JJ and Tylee\u0027s families.\n\n\u0022Most of us haven\u0027t felt this kind of pain or loss,\u0022 Lee Linde said during the closing prayer. \u0022I think we can all feel the pain of this loss whether you knew JJ and Tylee or not because this kind of tragedy affects us all.\u0022\n\nJJ\u0027s grandparents, Kay and Larry Woodcock, were unable to attend the vigil but watched a livestream on the EastIdahoNews.com Facebook page from their hotel room.  When it was over, Larry posted a message in the comments.\n\n\u0022God bless you all! Thank you for supporting the loss of our kids,\u0022 he wrote.",

      "description": "SALEM \u2014 As autopsy results for Tammy Daybell are still being finalized, a woman who knew and worked with Tammy and Chad Daybell years ago is revealing new information about their past.\n\nSuzanne Freeman was one of the first authors to have her work published by Spring Creek Book Company, which the Daybells launched in 2004. The first book, \u201CLed by the Hand of Christ,\u201D focused on Freeman\u2019s near-death experience, and over the next eight years, she partnered with Chad on two more projects.\n\n\u201CHe was interesting. He was very humble. When we were writing the first book, he called me up one day and said, \u2018Do you think maybe, possibly it would be OK . \u2026 Do you think maybe we could put a subtitle on the book?\u201D Freeman recalls, explaining Chad\u2019s hesitancy to make the request. \u201CI thought that was interesting. Why didn\u2019t he just come out with it? I didn\u2019t care what he did as long as he didn\u2019t change my story.\u201D\n\nChad wrote about meeting Freeman on his website in August 2015. After discussing \u201Cthat a humble housewife from a small Utah town had actually died, met the Savior, and returned,\u201D he wanted assurance that Freeman\u2019s experience was authentic.\n\n\u201CBefore I\u2019d even consider publishing her story, I wanted to make sure her account stayed consistent within itself,\u201D he wrote. \u201CI began asking her many questions to see if she would slip up or change her story, but throughout the \u2018interrogation,\u2019 she looked me in the eyes and was straightforward with her answers. After about 30 minutes, I felt satisfied and said, \u2018I believe you. I feel we should publish your experience.\u0027\u201D\n\nThe book was released, and Freeman began speaking about her story at different events. Years later, she learned Chad claimed to have two near-death experiences, and she found it odd that he had never said anything to her about them.\n\n\u201CHe never mentioned he had a near-death experience. We had a lot of conversations, and I would think that might come up,\u201D Freeman says. \u201CHaving an NDE (near-death experience) myself, people come to me and tell me their stories, but he never once told me a story. He only said he had some sacred experiences of his own, and I respected that. Usually, in my experience, if you had a near-death experience, people want to share it because they can\u2019t share it just to anybody, and I would totally be understanding.\u201D\n\nLeaving Spring Creek Book Company\n\nOver the years, Freeman remembers Chad\u2019s religious views aligning with the mainstream teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But in 2014, after releasing her third book, \u201CThe Spirit of Liberty,\u201D Chad suggested they combine all three of her publications and remove LDS references to make the story more mainstream. He also began working on projects that concerned Freeman.\n\n\u201CHe started publishing non-Mormon doctrine stories \u2013 people\u2019s different experiences and stuff, and I just told him there\u2019s something that\u2019s not quite right,\u201D Freeman says. \u201CPlus, we were working on a book of mine together to take out of the LDS stuff, and I was kind of surprised by that because he was an LDS author.\u201D\n\nChad came to Freeman and said he would be closing his business because the \u201Ccall-out\u201D was coming. The idea, which is not Latter-day Saint doctrine, is that the president of the church will one day call on members who are prepared to gather.\n\n\u201CThe prophet one day, before any tribulations \u2026 we\u2019ll be called out to go to the (LDS Church-owned) girls\u2019 camps,\u201D Freeman says. \u201COnly those that have their food storage and a temple recommend will go. He felt that was going to happen, I think it was July, so he was going to stop publishing books.\u201D\n\nFreeman says Chad believed the righteous would live together until earthquakes and calamities happened ahead of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. She had heard this idea in online chatrooms and forums, but it didn\u2019t make sense to her.\n\n\u201CIt seems to me that if you want to be safe, you wouldn\u2019t go where the government knows where the church has camps,\u201D Freeman says. \u201CI thought, \u2018I\u2019m not going where the government knows that.\u2019 I just never felt that was for me.\u201D\n\nChad and Freeman went their separate ways, but she says he promised to give her book rights back. When he didn\u2019t, she sought legal advice to discuss her options.\n\nat it and really kind and really genuine,\u201D Freeman says. \u201CHe would tell me she was his soulmate, and he knew her in the pre-existence, and when he met her, they knew each other. I was impressed by that. I thought, \u2018Wow. They have a really sweet relationship, and that\u2019s really tender.\u2019 I was impressed by him, how humble he was, and how he felt about his wife. That\u2019s not very common. I really was honored to be Chad\u2019s friend early on because I love to see good men. There\u2019s good men out there, \nand I like associating with good people.\u201D\n\nMore can be found here: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2020/06/author-who-worked-with-chad-daybell-says-hes-been-deceived-and-is-calling-on-him-to-do-the-right-thing/",

      "description": "It was Oct. 19, 2019. Melanie Gibb was in Arizona when she received a text message from a friend that Tammy Daybell had died.\n\nShe was startled but, then again, her friend, Lori Vallow, and Tammy\u0027s husband, Chad Daybell, had told her weeks earlier that Tammy would die.\n\n\u0022I didn\u2019t know how they did it, but I knew it was part of the plan that she was supposed to pass away,\u0022 Gibb tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u0022Other people knew she was supposed to pass away because Chad had this information for quite a while.\u0022\n\nGibb called Lori and asked if she had heard about Tammy\u0027s death. Lori said she had not and acted surprised, but this was the same woman who had told Gibb for months that she and Chad were supposed to be together. It was only natural that after Tammy\u0027s death, Chad and Lori would get married.\n\n\u0022Their whole goal was to get together because they expressed to me many times that Tammy would be OK with this as she passed on,\u0022 Gibb says. \u0022(They said) she may not remember it now, but she had a mission to fulfill on the other side, so they both felt that was where she was supposed to go.\u0022\n\n\nLori and Chad married in a private ceremony on a Hawaiian beach on Nov. 5 - less than three weeks after Tammy\u0027s death. Unbeknownst to Gibb, Tammy\u0027s children, Joshua \u0022JJ\u0022 Vallow and Tylee Ryan, were missing and hadn\u0027t been seen since September.\n\nGibb explained in part two of our series what Lori and Chad asked her to do when they returned to Rexburg, and police showed up at their door looking for the kids. Gibb refused to lie to officers but wanted to believe her friends. Finally, after a few days of soul-searching, she called Chad\u0027s phone and demanded answers. Lori answered.\n\n\u0022I think the first question I said is, \u0027Why haven\u2019t you told us where the kids are?\u0027\u0022 Gibb says. \u0022(Lori responded), \u0027Well, for your safety, we cannot tell you.\u0027 That was alarming to me. What safety? Why am I in danger? I didn\u2019t feel like I was in danger.\u0022\n\nGibb demanded to know why Lori had told the police that JJ and Tylee were with her. Lori admitted to lying but said it was for the safety of JJ. She refused to give Gibb any concrete answers on what was happening with the children and why she and Chad were not cooperating with law enforcement.\n\n\u0022It was a long conversation. I said, \u0027I\u2019m concerned for you. I\u2019m concerned for your salvation. This is darkness,\u0027\u0022 Gibb recalls. \u0022It was very uncomfortable talking to her. It was a disturbing conversation. I continued to tell her that I was concerned for them. And I am, and I was.\u0022\n\nGibb told Chad and Lori they were evil, and she did not have a testimony of the doctrine and teachings they had shared with her.\n\nThey hung up the phone and since that day, Gibb has not spoken to Chad or Lori again.\n\nWatch and read the entire story on EastIdahoNews.com.",

      "description": "REXBURG \u2014 Around two dozen people gathered at Kennedy Elementary School Monday night to commemorate Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow\u2019s 8th birthday.\n\nThe boy, who has been missing with his sister, 17-year-old Tylee Ryan, attended the school until his mother, Lori Vallow Daybell, withdrew him last September. Classmates, their parents, community members, Rexburg police officers and others were at the vigil.\n\nAfter lighting candles, a moment of silence was held before the group sang \u201CHappy Birthday\u201D to JJ. Jeanine Hansen, a Rexburg resident who has been following the case, read the following statement from Kay and Larry Woodcock, JJ\u2019s grandparents.\n\nAs you know, today is our beloved grandson, JJ\u2019s, 8th birthday. His absence is sorely felt by his brothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, Larry, me and the world. We were blessed with this special young man\u2019s eight short years ago. He has been a bright light and joy in our lives. The hope of seeing his sweet, smiling face again is what gets us out of bed everyday.\n\nTylee, with her beautiful smile and endearing sisterly ways, is our biggest hope they are being properly cared for.\n\nLori and Chad, YOU can speak out to end this agony. We pray you feel the humanity and compassion God has instilled within you to bring this nightmare to a close. It is the Christian thing to do.\n\nThe Rexburg area has encompassed us with love and warmth. We now feel this is our second home just as Facebook has been instrumental in communicating our story to the world. Thank you to every person who has shared, copied, pasted pictures and stories in whatever way you have helped to keep this story in the forefront. It\u2019s a worldwide effort to bring these two kids home.\n\nThank you all from the bottom of our hearts. Please let\u2019s keep JJ and Tylee at the forefront and your vigilance is greatly appreciated. We will never give up. Thanks and God bless each of you.\n\nThe Vallow \u0026 Woodcock family\n\nDaybell is in the Madison County Jail on two counts of desertion and nonsupport of a dependent child. She refuses to say where her children are and, in a new statement released Monday, Rexburg Police asked the public to contact them with new tips about JJ and Tylee\u2019s whereabouts.\n\n\u201CWe can\u2019t express enough how appreciative we are for all of the officers, the community, family members and news media outlets near and far who have dedicated thousands of hours in the search of J.J. and Tylee and that will continue to do so until we have resolve in this case,\u201D Asst. Chief Gary Hagen said in a news release.\n\nDaybell enrolled JJ at Kennedy Elementary on Sept. 3, 2019, according to principal Josh Wilson. Three weeks later, on Sept. 24, his mother unenrolled him and said she would homeschool the boy.\nTylee, 17, was last seen at Yellowstone National Park Police on Sept. 8 with JJ, Daybell and her brother, Alex Cox. The FBI and Rexburg Police are asking visitors who were at the park that day to submit images, video or other information that may assist in their investigation.\n\n\u201CWe continue to hope and pray for the safe return of both of these beautiful children each and every day,\u201D Hagen said. \u201CWe urge the public to continue to be vigilant for J.J. and Tylee and if you have any tips or information regarding their whereabouts, please contact the Rexburg Police Department at (208) 359-3008.\u201D",

      "title": "Part 2: Melanie Gibb describes zombies, JJ disappearing \u0026 the \u0027fatal attraction\u0027 between Chad \u0026 Lori",
      "description": "It was September 2019. Lori Vallow was moving to Rexburg, Idaho, from Gilbert, Arizona. She didn\u0027t want to go at first, according to her best friend, Melanie Gibb, but Chad Daybell insisted she make the move.\n\n\u0022She said she thought Chad would come to be with her in Arizona, and then she said, \u0027I changed my plans. I think I\u0027m supposed to be up there (in Idaho). He says I\u0027m supposed to be up there, but I need to get my own answer to find out if I\u2019m supposed to be there,\u0027\u0022 Gibb recalls.\n\nLori prayed and eventually, she said she received the answer that she needed to move to Rexburg to be with Chad, Gibb says. But there was one complication - Chad\u0027s wife, Tammy Daybell, was still alive.\n\n\u0022She was uncomfortable with it. She believed that Tammy was going to pass away, though, before she got up there,\u0022 Gibb says. \u0022That didn\u2019t happen. She didn\u2019t pass away before (Lori) got up there.\u0022\n\nGibb says Lori thought Tammy might die in a car crash -- but that didn\u0027t happen.\n\n\nLori moved into a townhouse in Rexburg with her two children, Joshua \u0022JJ\u0022 Vallow and Tylee Ryan, the first week of September. Lori\u0027s brother, Alex Cox, arrived a few days later and rented a different townhouse in the same complex. Gibb visited Sept. 19 and remembers walking around the Brigham Young University-Idaho campus and indoor track with Lori and Chad, who were holding hands and kissing. \n\n\u0022I said, \u0027Aren\u2019t you worried that people are going to see you?\u0027 She says, \u0027Well, Tammy doesn\u0027t come out a lot.\u0027 ... They said a lot of people that knew Chad didn\u0027t know what Tammy looked like because they didn\u0027t do a lot of things together,\u0022 Gibb says.\n\nDuring their walk, Alex babysat JJ at home, but Tylee was not there, and Lori never mentioned her. Weeks earlier, Gibb had spoken to Lori on the phone after she moved to Rexburg and heard Tylee yelling in the background, so she was surprised the 17-year-old was not around. \n\n\u0022I was told she was at (BYU-Idaho),\u0022 Gibb recalls. \u0022I knew that Tylee had her GED, which she got when she was 16 or 17 ... There were definitely question marks. It didn\u0027t feel real. It didn\u0027t feel like the truth. I didn\u2019t know what to say about it. I wouldn\u0027t assume that she had done something to her. It was unusual.\u0022\n\nEqually concerning was what Lori said about JJ when Gibb arrived in Idaho.\n\n\u0022She said that he had turned into a zombie the day before I got there, and she was pointing out behaviors of his. ... She was trying to create uncertainty in me about what I saw. ... I was looking at him and thought, \u0027I don\u0027t know. He looks just like JJ to me,\u0027\u0022 Gibb says.\n\nThis wasn\u0027t the first time Lori had spoken to Gibb about zombies.\n\nMore information and the complete story can be found at EastIdahoNews.com.",

      "description": "Eaton: So you do believe that Charles was shot in self-defense and Alex was defending himself?\n\n Melani:  Absolutely. And I went to Tylee and was like, \u0027How are you?\u0027 She was so brave speaking about it and was very collected and very mature. I admire Tylee so much for how brave she was. She explained everything and so did Lori and so did Alex and it made sense with how Charles has been acting. You\u0027re in shock that it went to that extreme but I\u0027m glad Alex was there to protect Tylee. \n\nI hated that Tylee had to go through that and I know there\u0027s been a lot of criticism of how Lori acted afterward. She\u0027s smiling on camera and I know when she\u0027s uncomfortable, she\u0027ll just kind of laugh or smile and try to make light of it. I do the same thing. It\u0027s just how we handle being in shock and every person handles being in shock differently.\n\nThat\u0027s when everything started to be strange. Charles had said all these things in court documents, things I had never heard Lori say, and that\u0027s when these strange ideas started flowing around. Lori has always been an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. She loves learning and she spent a lot of time in the temple trying to learn and grow from experiences and trying to feel peace from all the things that have happened in her life. \n\nCharles I feel took that to an extreme with the things that he said about her. Honestly I see everything Charles did...like the emails about his life insurance. Charles sold life insurance and had his own company and the texts between people it almost looked like a setup. It was very alarming to see all these things. \n\nI have been asked what spiritual experiences has Lori had. That\u0027s not for me to answer or to say what Lori and Chad\u0027s beliefs are. But I know the people they are and I know they\u0027re good people and they\u0027re trying. As a family, we\u0027d get together and talk about the mysteries of God and the deep doctrine conversations. We\u0027re allowed to do that. We\u0027re allowed to discern truth from error and just learn and in our church. We believe in revelation  and it\u0027s an ongoing process. We\u0027re learning continually and everything\u0027s changing. We\u0027re just people that are trying to grow in our faith and be closer to the Savior. \n\nThere\u0027s no cult. Lori\u0027s my aunt, Zulema\u0027s almost like an aunt to me, Alex is my uncle and this is my family. Where it comes down to Tylee and JJ and this zombie idea - it came from a disturbing phone call I got from one of Lori\u0027s old friends right after they took off to Hawaii. She told me Lori and Alex did something to Tylee and JJ and we don\u0027t know where they\u0027re at and Lori has lied to you and all these things that didn\u0027t feel right. On that phone call I felt a lot of fear and doubt and that\u0027s when I kind of went into this worrying phase.\n\nI\u0027m newly married and I\u0027m sharing these things with him and can\u0027t sleep some nights. I didn\u0027t know where they\u0027re at, I didn\u0027t know what was going on and I didn\u0027t understand these things. And Ian, which I don\u0027t know, is talking with Natalie and Brandon and they\u0027re telling him these terrifying things that aren\u0027t true - that I\u0027ve wanted to kill Brandon and I\u0027m in a cult. I have no idea what Ian\u0027s doing behind the scenes and I\u0027m in a scared time in my life where I\u0027m trying to figure out the pieces. I\u0027m trying to know what\u0027s going on with with Brandon and his plans and who he is working with and where my kids are. December was terrifying - like we\u0027re thrown into this boiling pot as soon as we get married and trying to just adapt as best we can.\n\n Eaton: Melani, did you actually believe these things that Lori and Chad told you? Or were you telling Ian just to get it off your chest with the assumption you didn\u0027t know what to think?\n\n Melani: Lori and Chad did not tell me most of those things in the document. Those were fears I was hearing from other people and never did I believe them. When you don\u0027t have knowledge about something and you\u0027re in a scary situation like this, you think the worst. And I\u0027m an open book. I kind of say it how it is. \n\nI didn\u0027t know Ian was recording all these things and that he was talking to Natalie or Brandon. I had told him my history with Brandon and I warned that Natalie\u0027s probably going to try to get a hold of Brandan and Brandon\u0027s going to run with all these lies about me. Ian knew who I was but the factor of Tylee and JJ going missing - he\u0027d never seen them before and had only met Chad and Lori one time. He doesn\u0027t know what I know about the past with Lori trying to do everything she can to protect her kids and people who have been threatening her. \n\nRead and watch the entire story on EastIdahoNews.com",

Melani lived next door to Daybell in Rexburg during the time her children were missing. Ian is currently involved in a custody battle with his ex-wife, Natalie Pawlowski, and Melani is in her own custody dispute with her ex-husband, Brandon Boudreaux. Brandon was shot at in October and believes Alex Cox, his ex-wife\u2019s uncle, was the shooter.\n\nThe Pawlowskis now live in Arizona and spoke with EastIdahoNews.com via Zoom Saturday with their attorneys, Garrett Smith and Robert Jarvis.\n\nBelow is a transcript of the second part of their interview. It has been lightly edited for clarity. You can watch and read the first part of our interview here.\n\n Nate Eaton, EastIdahoNews.com:  When is the last time you saw JJ and Tylee?\n\n Melani Pawlowski:  Ian has never met them but the last time I saw them they were packing up their home in Chandler where Charles had been shot. I remember how emotional it was just to be there. It was where this big thing happened. And Tylee thought it was hard being in the house after that situation happened. \n\nAnd Lori - sometimes she\u0027s had to do things to protect her kids. The court systems haven\u0027t protected her and Tylee and Colby were abused by their dad, Joe. The court system didn\u0027t protect them and she had this history of doing everything she could to protect Tylee and JJ. I\u0027ve always seen that in her since I was a teenager and she flew me out to go nanny for Tylee and JJ. I\u0027ve never seen any evidence, or anything at all, that tells me that Lori would purposely harm her children. It\u0027s hard all the attacks out there. I still see her as the wonderful mom she is. When I see her come in court, I\u0027m looking for something off that I\u0027m not seeing. Because I\u0027ve had every fear of where they could be but the last time I saw them was the end of August as they were moving because I think they moved up that first week in September.\n\nEaton: Did you visit Lori in Rexburg before you moved there?\n\nMelani:  I did I think on a weekend. My ex, Brandon Boudreaux, and I have 50/50 custody and  so anytime it wasn\u0027t my time with my kids I was a wreck and just missed my kids. I tried to go hike in Arizona or go on a trip and I did go visit Lori for a weekend up there (in Rexburg). She said, \u0027Just come. Try out somewhere new and come see if you like it up here.\u0027 We toured BYU-Idaho and she said Tylee was with friends. She always was with friends so I didn\u0027t ask any questions about that. And JJ is either doing some type of therapy or with a nanny or in a school that will help him. So if I didn\u0027t see him, I wasn\u0027t asking, \u0027Where is he?\u0027 I just have always trusted her. \n\nI had known that they left to Idaho because they were being threatened by people. I didn\u0027t want to ask so many questions and I didn\u0027t know what to do with that. And I was just there for love and support and I just wanted to be there to help you guys (Lori).\n\nThe entire interview can be watched at EastIdahoNews.com.",

It has been lightly edited for clarity. On Monday, we will post the rest of the interview including questions about JJ and Tylee, Lori and Chad, the Pawlowski\u2019s religious beliefs and why they are speaking out now.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE AND THE LATEST STORIES ON THE CASE\n\nNate Eaton, EastIdahoNews.com: The first thing I want to ask, Melani and Ian, is your reaction to the autopsy results which came out Friday concerning Melani\u2019s uncle, Alex Cox. What did you think when you heard the news?\n\nMelani Pawlowski It was relieving but we weren\u2019t surprised. We knew that it would be natural causes. We had no reason to think anything otherwise. I think it was just a comfort like, finally, this part is over and it\u2019s one more stepping stone to just keep revealing truth. And then the second half of the day, (Gilbert Police) say it\u2019s still under investigation. It feels like every time we get a little bit of good news, there\u2019s a little bit of drag too, but overall, just relief and comfort to be in the right direction.\n\nEaton: You mentioned that police are still investigating and there is going to be people watching that still don\u2019t believe the results or say there\u2019s something more here. What do you say to them?\n\nMelani: You post truth out there and people have already made up their minds and decided. Ian made a bad joke saying, \u2018Did they test for all the invisible poisons?\u2019 People will still think whatever speculation or rumors or whatever they want to believe even when it\u2019s right in front of their face.\n\nWhen Tylee and JJ show up and are here again, I don\u2019t know if people would even believe it. They still go on with their own\u2026it\u2019s still they\u2019ve done something bad and a lot of people have already made up their minds.\n\nWe just want to come on and share what we do know and share truth and hopefully keep getting opportunities where more people will be open to that and be able to listen.\n\nEaton: Melani, Alex was your uncle and a lot of people have thrown questions out there as to why he died. Was this just a big coincidence? Did you think there might be something more here?\n\nMelani: There was absolute shock when I got the phone call from Zulema Pastenes (Alex Cox\u2019s wife) and she was telling me (he had died). I had spoken with Alex earlier that day and he seemed okay, but I knew the week before he was having trouble. He was, overall, a pretty healthy guy, but stubborn. He wouldn\u2019t do regular checkups and was just was a tough guy.\n\nI was going to bring him some of his stuff because he had moved down to be with Zulema and he had said, \u2018Let\u2019s not meet up halfway. Let\u2019s wait. I\u2019m not feeling very good.\u2019 That was big for him to say that because he never would say that he wasn\u2019t feeling good.\n\nThe week before he said he had tightness in his chest and trouble breathing. He said he had bent down to get a water bottle and took the breath out of him. I was absolutely worried and was like, you need to get to the doctor. And he was like, \u2018No, no, no, I\u2019m fine.\u2019\n\nSo that morning, I called him and Ian was at work. He was somebody I could kind of just \u2013 you could tell him anything. He\u2019s like a vault. I was just openly telling him about things in my new marriage, things that were, challenging or things that were going really well and he was just my best friend at that point. He shared some things that I just felt I needed to write them down when he started talking to me.\n\nFind the entire story here: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2020/05/melani-pawlowski-speaks-about-her-rough-childhood-family-deaths-and-her-sudden-las-vegas-wedding/",

Following more than two hours of arguments, Magistrate Judge Michelle Mallard ruled there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to support the motion and denied the request.\n\n\u201CI cannot find any good cause to reduce the bond further than it already has,\u201D she said. \u201CI would advise Mr. Means consult with local defense attorneys who I\u2019m sure have come up with alternatives during this time \u2026 about ways to surmount any virus problems at the jail in regards to communicating with clients.\u201D\n\nDaybell, wearing a protective face mask due to COVID-19 precautions, looked down as the ruling was made. She was arrested in Hawaii in February after a monthslong investigation into the disappearance of her two children, Joshua \u201CJ.J.\u201D Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 17, from Rexburg. The two still have not been found after going missing last September.\n\nRead the entire story here: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2020/05/lori-vallow-daybell-to-remain-in-jail-on-1-million-bail/",

      "description": "IDAHO FALLS \u2014 Dateline NBC will air a two-hour program Friday with new information and interviews in the case of two missing Rexburg children.\n\nTylee Ryan, 17, and Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, 7, have not been seen since September. Their mother, Lori Vallow Daybell, is in the Madison County Jail on two counts of desertion and nonsupport of dependent children. The Idaho Attorney General\u2019s Office is investigating Daybell and her new husband, Chad Daybell, for the death of Tammy Daybell, Chad\u2019s wife who died suddenly in October.\n\nThe major players and timeline in the disappearance of JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan\n\nDateline aired an episode about the investigation on Feb. 14. Since then, there have been numerous developments and EastIdahoNews.com has been working with NBC producers and correspondent Keith Morrison on the upcoming program.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s a shocking story and a remarkable story,\u201D Morrison tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CI\u2019ve seen public interest in cases before but this really is far more than anything I\u2019ve seen in a very long time \u2013 since maybe Michael Jackson or OJ Simpson.\u201D\n\nMorrison interviewed several people who are closely tied to Lori and Chad, including Lori\u2019s niece Melani Pawlowski and her new husband Ian. The couple has not spoken publicly about the case but sat down with Dateline for hours and no questions were off the table.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE AND THE LATEST NEWS ON THE DAYBELL CASE\n\nMelani\u2019s husband, Brandon Boudreaux, was shot at Oct. 2 in Gilbert, Arizona. Investigators believe Lori\u2019s dead brother, Alex Cox, may have been the shooter. After Brandon and Melani divorced, she quickly married Ian and moved to Rexburg.\n\n\u201CMelani essentially appeared to want to present that all is fine,\u201D Morrison says of the interview. \u201CShe acted like, \u2018I don\u2019t know of any problems whatsoever. We were all just doing our own thing and anything that seemed suspicious was merely a coincidence.\u2019 She\u2019s a sweet, very attractive young woman who looks at you with big eyes and says it\u2019s absolutely the truth. The viewers can look at it and see what they think.\u201D\n\n\n\nDuring the show, Morrison explores Chad and Lori\u2019s religious beliefs, including reports the couple thought JJ and Tylee had become \u201Cdark\u201D and were \u201Czombies.\u201D Ian Pawlowski allegedly wrote about the bizarre beliefs the night he married Melani and she explained what Chad and Lori had told her. She also reportedly expressed that Brandon had been possessed by a demon or \u201Canother dark entity.\u201D\n\nRELATED | Zombies, shootings, dark beings: What new court documents suggest about Lori Daybell\n\n\u201CThere are all these people who surround Chad and Lori who appear to be part of this group,\u201D Morrison says. \u201CWhen you hear people talk seriously about evil spirits inhabiting their spouses or members of their family, or people becoming zombies and needing to be eliminated, you\u2019re getting into some serious stuff. And those are the kinds of materials we have found ourselves dealing with over this period of time.\u201D\n\nWatch our interview with Morrison in the video player above to learn more about the program. It will air on KPVI Friday, May 1 at 8 p.m. MST. The episode will be posted online a few days after it premieres on television.",

      "description": "REXBURG \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell is again asking a judge to lower her $1 million bail as EastIdahoNews.com has discovered new information about events that led up to her marriage to Chad Daybell.\n\nLori remains in the Madison County Jail on two charges of desertion and nonsupport of dependent children. Her 7-year-old son, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, and 17-year-old daughter, Tylee Ryan, have not been seen since September.\n\nLori married Chad Daybell on Nov. 5, 2019 in Hawaii \u2013 less than three weeks after Chad\u2019s 49-year-old wife, Tammy Daybell, suddenly died in her sleep. Wedding photos obtained by Fox 10 Phoenix show Chad and Lori on the beach laughing and holding each other. One picture displays the wedding ring on Lori\u2019s hand.\n\nEastIdahoNews.com has learned the ring, a size 4 Sterling Silver Southwestern Style Malachite Gemstone, was purchased on Amazon for $35.99 on Oct. 2, 2019 \u2013 17 days before Tammy Daybell passed away.\n\nA screenshot of the order, verified by three people close to the investigation, shows the ring was delivered Oct. 7 to the townhome where Lori was staying on Pioneer Road in Rexburg. The name on the order was Charles Vallow \u2013 Lori\u2019s husband who had been shot and killed by her brother, Alex Cox, nearly three months earlier. Sources say Lori continued to use Vallow\u2019s Amazon account after he died.\n\nA website history on the computer from which the ring was ordered also showed someone searching for wedding dresses the next day, according to sources close to the investigation.\n\nOct. 2 is a significant date in the case because it\u2019s the same day surveillance footage shows Lori and a man believed to be Chad Daybell visiting Self Storage Plus in Rexburg. The couple was seen dropping off a tire and rear car seat around 2:30 p.m.\n\nBrandon Boudreaux, the ex-husband of Lori Daybell\u2019s niece, Melani Pawlowski, was also shot at that same day in Arizona. Rich Robertson, a private investigator hired by Boudreaux, believes Cox was the shooter. Cox suddenly died two months later and autopsy results have not been publicly released.\n\nLori\u2019s wedding ring is made of malachite \u2013 a mineral often called the \u201Cstone of transformation.\u201D It\u2019s used in energy healings and was mentioned in a document allegedly written by Melani\u2019s new husband \u2013 Ian Powlaski.\n\nIan reportedly describes what Melani told him about Lori\u2019s religious beliefs. Under one section he wrote, \u201Cmalachite is said to have healing properties.\u201D\n\nLori\u2019s next court appearance is scheduled for May 7 but in a motion filed Tuesday, Mark Means, her attorney, requested oral arguments before Magistrate Judge Michelle Mallard concerning her bail. Means noted that \u201Cnew facts have come to light\u201D since a previous bond hearing. Mallard recently took over the case after Means requested that Magistrate Judge Farren Eddins step down.\n\nMeans does not detail the new information in the court filings and a bond hearing had not been set as of Wednesday morning. Chad Daybell has not been arrested or charged with any crimes.",

      "description": "REXBURG \u2014 Enhanced, higher-quality surveillance footage appears to answer questions about who visited Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s storage unit in Rexburg last year.\n\nThe video may provide insights into the disappearance of her children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and Tylee Ryan, who have been missing since September. She is in the Madison County Jail on $1 million bail and charged with two counts of felony child desertion and nonsupport of children, along with several misdemeanors.\n\nShe rented the unit at Self Storage Plus in Rexburg on Oct. 1. Over the next two months, she and sometimes one or two men visited the locker 10 times. Personal belongings were put into storage, including children\u2019s items, a photo album, blankets featuring pictures of the children and bikes and scooters.\n\nRELATED | Lori Daybell abandoned a storage unit in Rexburg full of children\u2019s items\n\nThe big question is who was with her when she visited the facility Oct. 2.\n\nMeanwhile, in Arizona \u2026\n\nThat morning, in Gilbert, Arizona, Brandon Boudreaux was shot at while driving home from the gym. At the time, he was married to Lori\u2019s niece, Melanie Pawlowski, and court documents show he had a large life insurance policy and assets totaling more than a million dollars.\n\nThe bullet missed Boudreaux\u2019s head by inches, and police say the person who shot at him was driving a Jeep registered to Charles Vallow, Lori\u2019s former husband. At this point, Vallow had been dead for nearly three months, and Tylee routinely drove the Jeep, but she had been missing for about a month.\n\nRich Robertson, a private investigator from Arizona, said police have strong evidence Alex Cox, Daybell\u2019s brother, was the driver and may have been the one who took the shot. Arizona police have not confirmed who they believe was driving the Jeep when the shooting occurred.\n\nPawlowski has denied she had anything to do with the attempt on Boudreaux\u2019s life, and her lawyers said Cox could not have been in Arizona and Idaho at the same time.\n\nRELATED | Niece of Lori Daybell says ex-husband\u2019s claims are false, makes explosive allegations of her own\n\nHere\u2019s what we see on the video of the Rexburg storage unit that day.\n\nSurveillance video shows Daybell driving into the business in her blue Nissan Rogue with a man EastIdahoNews.com originally thought was Alex Cox, her brother.\n\nA closer look at enhanced video recently obtained by EastIdahoNews.com shows it likely wasn\u2019t Cox but Chad Daybell, her now-husband, based on the man\u2019s walk, looks and mannerisms.\n\nTimestamps on the video show a blue Rogue arriving at 1:25 p.m. but the owner of the storage facility says clocks were off by one hour, so Lori actually pulled in at 2:25 p.m. She made her way to the door of the building where her unit was, and two minutes later, at 2:27 p.m., got out of the vehicle with the man we believe is Chad.\nSo why does this matter?\n\nThat same morning, Brandon Boudreaux was shot at in Gilbert, Arizona, while driving home from the gym. At the time, he was married to Lori\u2019s niece, Melanie Pawlowski, and court documents show he had a large life insurance policy and assets totaling over a million dollars.\n\nThe bullet missed Boudreaux\u2019s head by inches, and police say the person who shot at him was driving a Jeep registered to Charles Vallow, Lori\u2019s former husband. At this point, Vallow had been dead for nearly three months, and Tylee routinely drove the Jeep, but she had been missing for about a month.\n\nRich Robertson, a private investigator from Arizona, said police have strong evidence Cox was the driver and may have been the one who took the shot. Arizona police have not confirmed who they believe was driving the Jeep when the shooting occurred.\n\nPawlowski has denied she had anything to do with the attempt on Boudreaux\u2019s life, and her lawyers said Cox could not have been in Arizona and Idaho in that short of time.\n\nRELATED | Niece of Lori Daybell says ex-husband\u2019s claims are false, makes explosive allegations of her own\n\nThe next day, surveillance footage shows a second man visiting the storage unit back in Idaho with Lori. This man, likely Cox, walks differently than Chad and carries the tire out rather than rolling it. He also carries the car seat by himself, rather than working with her like the day before.\n\nOriginally it was thought the vehicle seat could be a tote with something hanging over the end but the enhanced footage appears to clear up the confusion. It\u2019s unknown where Lori and Cox took the seat and tire after leaving the storage facility.\n\n\nClick here for the entire story:  https://www.eastidahonews.com/2020/03/enhanced-video-footage-shows-who-visited-lori-vallows-storage-unit-the-same-day-her-relative-was-shot-at-in-arizona/",

      "description": "REXBURG -- It\u0027s likely the Madison County Sheriff\u0027s Office has never had an inmate as high-profile as Lori Vallow Daybell. \n\nThe 46-year-old mother waived extradition Wednesday afternoon in Hawaii on charges of desertion and nonsupport of children, resisting and/or obstructing an officer, solicitation and contempt. Daybell\u2019s children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 17, have not been seen since September.\n\n\u0022It takes some planning and time logistically to accomplish this type of transport so it\u2019s going to take a few days, at least, to get her back to Idaho,\u0022 says Sgt. Isaac Payne, the spokesman for the Madison County Sheriff\u0027s Office. \u0022We are going to make sure routes are secured. We always travel with multiple offices and we utilize local and federal agencies to make sure every security measure is taken.\u0022\n\nOnce Daybell arrives at the Madison County Jail, she will be housed with other women. Payne says she will be treated like any other inmate, although extra security measures may be taken for Daybell\u0027s safety as it\u0027s likely other inmates will know who she is when she arrives.\n\n\u0022They all have access to network television, they all watch TV for a great deal of their day so I have no doubt they know who she is,\u0022 Payne says. \u0022That being said, we don\u2019t segregate people merely based on who they are. We have to be fair and consistent across the board.\u0022\n\n\nThe jail holds a standing headcount for all inmates every day at 7 a.m. Breakfast is served at 7:30 a.m. and lunch is ready at 11:30 a.m. Another headcount is held in the afternoon and evening with dinner being served at 5:30 p.m. Lockdown occurs at 11 p.m.\n\nInmates are offered an hour of recreational time every day where they can check out books from the jail library or exercise. On weekends, they are welcome to attend religious services held at the facility.\n\n\u0022Anyone who has been an inmate says that the hardest thing is the monotony of it but routine equals safety. If we do the same thing every day, there\u2019s a consistency to it,\u0022 Payne says.\n\nEvery inmate has a cellmate, although there are some single cells that Payne says are usually used for those who have special needs. Different areas of the jail can be compartmentalized, so if Daybell needed to be separate from others, deputies could move her to a smaller section.\n\nInmates are only allowed face-to-face visits with attorneys and clergy. All other visits are done through a video chat system with each inmate receiving an hour of free calls each week. Extra visiting time can be purchased by those inside or outside the jail.\n\nWhile she\u0027s incarcerated, Daybell will eat \u0022the best jail food in the state,\u0022 according to Payne. Every meal is handmade on-site and supervised by a licensed nutritionist.\n\n\u0022We don\u2019t ship in meals, we ship in ingredients,\u0022 Payne says. \u0022We have a full-service kitchen and all meals meet nutritional standards. We have homemade bread, fresh fruit and vegetables and even the staff eats the food.\u0022\n\nThe Madison County Jail can hold approximately 100 people and often houses federal inmates. The facility has room for around 20 women but if more space is needed for females, the jail can be reconfigured.\n\nAs court proceedings begin for Daybell, the national media plans to be in Rexburg and many members of the public may want to observe hearings. Payne says the sheriff\u0027s office is prepared and will work to make sure everyone is safe.\n\n\u0022Even though we have this high profile case going on, we still want to serve the public. If you have traffic tickets or court fees or need to get a driver\u0027s license, we want to make sure we\u2019re still serving the public that way,\u0022 he says.",

She will be brought back to Idaho on charges of desertion and nonsupport of children, resisting and/or obstructing an officer, solicitation and contempt.\n\nDaybell appeared for a court hearing and asked Judge Kathleen Watanabe to reduce her bond from $5 million. Her attorney argued that the amount was excessive considering her accused crimes.\n\n\u201CHer husband lives here and she has established residency here in the past,\u201D Craig De Costa, her attorney, said during the hearing. \u201CShe\u2019s more than willing to post bail if reduced to a reasonable amount and actually pay for herself to go back to Idaho and face those charges.\u201D\n\nKauai County Prosecuting Attorney Justin Kollar argued that $5 million bail is more than sufficient and noted Daybell has a history of defying court orders, including child custody cases in 2009 and 2011.\n\n\u201COur position remains that Ms. Daybell certainly is a flight risk, she has resided in numerous states in recent years and is in open defiance to court orders,\u201D Kollar said. \u201CShe should be remanded without bond but in the alternative, the 5 million dollars was appropriate at the time and remains appropriate today.\u201D\n\nWhen Judge Watanabe denied Daybell\u2019s request, De Costa said his client wishes to waive extradition and return to Idaho immediately.

      "description": "IDAHO FALLS -- Ursula Berliner will never forget her encounter with Lori Vallow Daybell. It was short, on an airport shuttle in Maui and an experience Berliner describes as \u0022chilling.\u0022\n\nThe Oregon mother had just landed in Hawaii with her husband and daughter last week when they made their way to pick up a rental car. As they boarded the shuttle, she recognized Lori and Chad from stories she had seen in the news. Lori\u2019s children, 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and his sister, 17-year-old Tylee Ryan, have not been seen since September. \n\n\u0022Chad was really recognizable but Lori looked a lot different than the pictures I had seen,\u0022 Berliner tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u0022She was dressed in black, heavy clothes and it was 80 degrees outside. She had big bags under her eyes. I had eye contact with her and she just looked like she felt untouchable - like she knew people would recognize her and it didn\u2019t bother her.\u0022\n\nBerliner said her heart \u0022sank to her legs\u0022 and she was concerned the Daybells may be on the run from law enforcement. After getting off the shuttle, she tried to call police but she couldn\u0027t get a cell phone signal. The couple went inside to rent a vehicle while Berliner remained outdoors with her family. \n\n\u0022I had just read that she had been talking to a friend and told her all the speculation around them was media hype that she was waiting for it to die down,\u0022 Berliner recalls. \u0022I wanted to have an exchange with her where she knew it wasn\u2019t just the media and the police who were watching for them or cared about the children - that there are parents all over, just like me, who see her and are watching her. People who aren\u2019t going to stop looking for the children.\u0022\n\nBerliner says Lori looked right at her through the glass and Berliner mouthed the words, \u0022I see you. Where are your children?\u0022\n\n\u0022I\u2019ll never forget the look on her face. She kind of shrugged and raised the corner of her mouth and eyebrow and she wanted me to know she knows where they are,\u0022 Berliner says. \u0022I really wanted to say something but it was a scary situation. There\u2019s a lot of death around the case and my husband was really nervous about me making a scene.\u0022\n\nBerliner and her family got into their rental car and drove away. She sent her photos to the Rexburg Police Department and detectives referenced them in court documents as proof that the Daybells did not have Lori\u0027s children with them.\n\nTwo days after Berliner\u0027s encounter, the Daybells returned to Kauai and on Thursday, on two counts of desertion and nonsupport of children, resisting and/or obstructing an officer, solicitation and contempt. \n\n\u0022Part of me was hoping I would see them again. I just don\u2019t want them to fall out of view but also I hope I never see them again. It was just an awful exchange with her,\u0022 Berliner says.",

      "description": "Lori Vallow Daybell remains in the Kauai Community Correctional Center on $5 million bail. Police continue to search for her children and in an affidavit of probable cause released Friday, detectives say Tylee was last seen Sept. 8 at Yellowstone National Park - a fact her aunt, Annie Cushing, is relieved to know.\n\n\u0022One of the really pressing questions that I\u2019ve asked throughout this entire thing is when was Tylee last seen,\u0022 Cushing says. \u0022I\u2019ve asked that question over and over and over...I was glad to have some kind of date stamp. But at the same time, it was clearly a disconcerting thought of her being out at this national park with this cast of characters and just wondering what they had on their minds.\u0022\n\nLori married Cushing\u0027s brother, Joe Ryan, in 2002. They were \u0022madly in love\u0022 and Ryan couldn\u0027t wait to be a father, Cushing recalls. Lori was \u0022delightful\u0022 and loved being a mother but in 2018, Cushing noticed some serious red flags.\n\n\u0022She was much more fixated on the end times,\u0022 Cushing says. \u0022In one conversation, she brought it up three different times with what seemed like an increasing sense of urgency. She definitely seemed very scared about the end times and that was when she crossed the line and said, \u0027I think sometimes it would be better to put my kids in a car and go over the side of a cliff.\u0027\u0022\n\nCushing showed visible shock on her face and Lori immediately walked back her statement - saying she was only joking. But Cushing has never forgotten the conversation.\n\nRyan died of an apparent heart attack in 2018 at age 59. He and Lori had gone through a contentious divorce, according to Cushing, and now she wonders if there may have been more to her brother\u0027s death.\n\n\u0022I really just go back and forth because on the one hand, it is feasible that he could have died of a heart attack because heart disease does run in our family. At the same time, I have questions about the autopsy,\u0022 Cushing says. She notes that Ryan\u0027s height and build were incorrect and he had been dead around a week before he was found.\n\nCushing will likely never have her questions answered surrounding Ryan\u0027s as he was cremated. He did have a life insurance policy but she is unsure who received the money.\n\n\u0022There\u2019s no question in my mind Joe absolutely would have had life insurance and there\u2019s absolutely no question Lori would not have been the beneficiary,\u0022 Cushing says. \u0022I do wonder if he had it in a trust for Tylee that matured when she turned 17 because JJ was last seen the day before Tylee\u2019s 17th birthday. I have no idea but everything surrounding this whole ordeal seems to be motivated by money.\u0022\n\nCushing in confident Lori will face additional charges and she believes others could be arrested in connection to the children\u0027s disappearance. She has become Tylee\u0027s public advocate - putting together her own timeline of the case and speaking out on behalf of her missing niece.\n\n\u0022It\u2019s just been the most mind-numbing thing to watch,\u0022 she says, choking back tears. \u0022It\u2019s just the most bizarre thing I\u2019ve ever seen play out. I live in New York City and it\u2019s weird to walk by a newsstand and see my family. Yet whatever I\u2019m suffering pales in comparison to what these kids suffered.\u0022\n\nBerliner returned home from Hawaii a few days ago and continues to follow new developments in the case. She hopes justice is served for the sake of JJ and Tylee.\n\n\u0022Those children are so darling. I hope they\u2019re still alive and they\u2019ll be found but it\u2019s just so heartless and cruel for a mother to neglect them like that,\u0022 she says.",

      "description": "In our coverage of Chad and Lori Vallow Daybell and her missing children, JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan, people who have known them say they have extreme religious beliefs and are members of a doomsday \u0022cult.\u0022\n\nBut the nature of the reported cult is hard to define, especially since the Daybells have not spoken to the media. We have tried.\n\nWhat we do know is Chad and Lori are or have been members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and they are also affiliated with several informal groups whose teachings go contrary to what one would hear in a typical Latter-day Saint congregation.\n\nWe reached out to several people in east Idaho who were or are part of these semi-secretive groups. Several have agreed to go on the record with their names, and others have agreed on the condition of anonymity, as they are still active Latter-day Saints or fear retaliation from other members of these groups.\n\nThere doesn\u0027t appear to be any sort of formal organization or clear doctrine among these nonconventional groups of Latter-day Saints. In fact, many of the people interviewed by EastIdahoNews.com reported vastly different experiences.\n\n\u0022I think \u0027cult\u0027 is such a weird word because it doesn\u0027t accurately describe what\u0027s happening,\u0022 a woman we\u0027ll call Jessica said. \u0022An \u0027extremist group\u0027 is a better term.\u0022 \n\nIt started when Jessica and her husband moved to eastern Idaho in 2015. A man in their new congregation -- called a ward -- approached her and said he was \u0022spiritually prompted\u0022 to offer her a job.\n\nShe accepted the job and worked at the business, which was out of the man\u0027s home.\n\nShe found her new boss had beliefs that were different than what\u0027s typically taught in the church. For example, Latter-day Saints believe God gives people spiritual gifts to help them serve others. The man who hired her took this belief to an extreme. \n\nHe claimed to have power to see spirits and cast out evil spirits from people. He would counsel with people in his home who were supposedly struggling with evil spirits inside of them, and he would claim to cast the spirits out. She said he wasn\u0027t fulfilling a church role or acting in any official capacity.\n\n\u0022His friends knew about his spiritual gifts, and they would tell their friends, so it was all word of mouth,\u0022 she said. \u0022People came to him to be healed.\u0022\n\nHe even appeared to heal Jessica of her celiac, blood sugar and thyroid issues. As a result, she stopped taking all her medications and supplements and ate gluten products again.\n\nHer boss\u0027s gifts seemed to extend into the digital realm too. Once when the business was having computer problems, he invoked his spiritual power to repair a broken computer server. Other times, if there was a bad internet connection, he might blame it on some sort of spiritual interference. \n\n\u0022I knew it was different, but at the time, I wasn\u0027t going to judge what works for somebody,\u0022 Jessica said. \u0022In my mind, I was working there because God wanted me too, and I wasn\u0027t going to question God.\u0022   \n\nGo to EastIdahoNews.com for the complete story.",

We are relieved. We are ready for the next step which for Lori is: where are the kids? Where are the kids? Where are the kids?\u201D Kay Woodcock tells EastIdahoNews.com.\n\nDaybell, 46, was arrested on a Madison County warrant that was delivered to her by the Kauai Police Department. She is now being held at the Kauai Police Department Detention Facility on $5 million bond pending extradition to Idaho.\n\nHer two children, 17-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJ.J.\u201D Vallow, have been missing since September.\n\nDaybell failed to comply with a court order to produce her children before authorities on Jan. 30 in Madison County, according to a Kauai Police Department news release.\n\nDaybell is charged with two counts of felony desertion of a child, as well as misdemeanor charges of resisting and obstructing an officer, solicitation of a crime and contempt. The complaint filed by the Madison County Prosecutor\u2019s Office alleges that Vallow abandoned her two minor children, delayed law enforcement\u2019s attempts to locate her children and encouraged another individual to delay law enforcement\u2019s attempts to locate her children.\n\nThe prosecutor also alleges that Daybell disobeyed a court order to physically produce her children to authorities in Idaho.\n\n\u201CFirst of all, we wish to thank the public for the massive outpouring of concern regarding this case,\u201D Kauai Chief of Police Todd G.

      "description": "REXBURG \u2014 It has been five months since Tylee Ryan and Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow vanished. Their mother, Lori Vallow Daybell, and her husband, Chad Daybell, have been in Hawaii living in a gated community, staying at different resorts and biking together around the island of Kauai.\n\nMultiple sources tell EastIdahoNews.com the couple boarded a plane Sunday afternoon for Maui. It\u2019s unknown how long they plan to stay or if they will return to Kauai but law enforcement in Idaho and Hawaii say they are aware of the Daybell\u2019s location.\n\n\n\nChad and Lori Daybell refused to answer any questions when approached by EastIdahoNews.com reporter Nate Eaton in Kauai on Jan. 26. | Eric Grossarth, EastIdahoNews.com\nFrank Montoya worked for the FBI over 25 years and served in a variety of high-profile positions, including the head of national counterintelligence and as the special agent in charge of the Honolulu and Seattle divisions. Montoya oversaw counterintelligence squads and led several national security investigations but says he has never seen a case like this.\n\n\u201CThis is pretty out there. This is strange and bizarre,\u201D Montoya tells EastIdahoNews.com. \u201CWhen you\u2019re looking at the number of people who are dead that are associated with either individual at the center of this case, and when you consider the missing children and how long they\u2019ve been gone, there\u2019s something very suspicious about their behavior.\u201D\n\n\n\nFrank Montoya, a retired FBI special agent in charge, speaks with EastIdahoNews.com reporter Nate Eaton via Facetime from his Utah home. Watch the entire interview in the video player above.\nDespite the unusual circumstances, Montoya says police and prosecutors are being careful in how they proceed. While arresting Chad and Lori Daybell may seem like an easy solution, it\u2019s not that simple.\n\n\u201CThe bottom line is what would be the crime? The children are missing but what does that mean? Where are they? If they\u2019re in the care and custody of a family member or friend or somewhere else but they\u2019re still alive, what are we looking at with potential crimes to charge these people with? Maybe child endangerment. Beyond that, at this point, I\u2019m not sure,\u201D Montoya says.\n\nLori Daybell was served with a child protection order on Jan. 25 stating she must produce JJ and Tylee to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare or Rexburg Police Department within five days. The notice stated that she could face civil or criminal contempt of court by failing to comply.\n\nShe never produced the children and the case is sealed, so it\u2019s unknown what happened with the court order but Montoya says authorities could use Daybell\u2019s non-compliance as leverage.\n\n\u201CThere may very well be grounds to have her extradited back to Idaho to at least address the question as to where the children are,\u201D he says. \u201CBut it\u2019s all about patience. There are a lot of jurisdictions involved, there\u2019s a lot of interest in law enforcement to resolve it and they\u2019re going to be putting forth their best effort but patience for the public is key.\u201D\n\n\n\nMontoya finds it unusual that the Daybells are spending their time in \u201Cparadise\u201D but is confident law enforcement officers are tracking their every move. The FBI is assisting with the case, meaning local police departments have access to the agency\u2019s forensic evidence lab and behavioral science program.\n\nWhile it may appear to the public that investigators aren\u2019t doing anything, Montoya says a lot is happening behind the scenes and police are leaving \u201Cno stone unturned.\u201D\n\n\u201CYour biggest fear as an investigator is when the lead well dries up. So keeping it high profile, using the media to promote the investigation, talking to a lot of different jurisdictions \u2013 they\u2019re doing anything and everything they can do to uncover more leads,\u201D he says.\n\nThe major players and timeline in the disappearance of JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan\n\nMontoya says it\u2019s important for the public to send in tips, even if they seem insignificant, and to trust the legal process. His experience shows that if the couple eventually decides to cooperate with law enforcement, it will likely be Chad who talks.\n\n\u201CI would note in cases like this that it\u2019s the woman who is the hard nut to crack. The husband is usually the one who comes clean first,\u201D Montoya says. \u201CIt\u2019s frustrating the parents aren\u2019t talking, it\u2019s frustrating they\u2019re having a grand old time in Hawaii but maybe at some point, their conscience finally gets to one of them.\u201D",

      "description": "IDAHO FALLS \u2014 Keith Morrison has been a news reporter for over 45 years and says he has never seen another story like the Chad and Lori Daybell case.\n\nThe Dateline NBC correspondent, known for his dramatic delivery of real-life murder mysteries, has been working with his team and EastIdahoNews.com on a two-hour special called \u201CWhere Are the Children?\u201D that will air Friday night.\n\nPREVIEW | Dateline NBC airing 2 hour special on Daybell case with new footage of couple at Hawaii resort\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s nothing like anything else. I\u2019ve been doing this for a long time and this stands alone,\u201D Morrison said Thursday afternoon during a FaceTime interview from an edit bay at NBC News Headquarters in New York City. \u201CTo make sure we get everything just right, we\u2019ve had screenings for senior producers and lawyers\u2026and anybody who has seen this for the first time is gobsmacked.\u201D\n\nJoshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow and his sister, Tylee Ryan, have not been seen since September. They were living in Rexburg with their mother, Lori Vallow Daybell. She and her new husband, Chad Daybell, are considered persons of interest in the disappearance. The couple has been in Hawaii for at least two months while police in Arizona investigate the death of Lori\u2019s former husband, Charles Vallow, and police in Idaho investigate the death of Chad\u2019s deceased wife, Tammy Daybell. Lori\u2019s brother, Alex Cox, also passed away in December and an investigation is underway into his death.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s so disturbing,\u201D Morrison says. \u201CWhen I read Chad Daybell\u2019s book and he described what he called near-death experiences, it\u2019s the kind of thing one hears when these things go bad. I\u2019ve heard a lot and when you begin to hear those kinds of stories, potentially you\u2019ve got some trouble.\u201D\n\nMorrison interviewed several associates of Chad and Lori. Many are speaking for the first time about unusual behavior they\u2019ve witnessed in their friends over the years and to raise awareness that JJ and Tylee are still missing.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019ve been able to use those people in a way that I think hasn\u2019t been done before. I think we\u2019re able to kind of bring the whole story into one and you\u2019ll see, sort of, from beginning to end everything to do with this story,\u201D Morrison says.\n\nDateline was with EastIdahoNews.com Jan. 26 when the Daybells were served search warrants outside a Kauai resort. Cameras were rolling as the couple ignored questions for three minutes. Both news organizations have been working together since December covering this complex story that spans several states.\n\n\u201CThe relationship we\u2019ve had with (EastIdahoNews.com) has been so helpful. We share materials, share breaks in the story, share ideas. You\u2019ve been tremendous for us,\u201D Morrison says.\n\nThe veteran newsman has visited eastern Idaho several times over the years, most recently for his reports on the Angie Dodge murder case. He\u2019s familiar with Idaho Falls and while eating lunch at Great Harvest last week, two women stopped to compliment his work. It likely happens everywhere he goes, and Morrison remains humble about his fame.\n\nWATCH | NBC News Correspondent discusses Chris Tapp case, future of journalism\n\n\u201CPeople are very, very nice. It feels like I have friends everywhere,\u201D he says with a smile.\n\nDateline NBC will produce follow-up episodes as the case continues to develop. You can watch \u201CWhere Are the Children?\u201D Friday at 8 p.m. on KPVI Channel 6. The show will also be posted online here.",

Surveillance cameras at the facility show Daybell and a man associated with her visited the unit nine times in October and once in November. Often the man came alone.\n\nSecurity footage shows she only came to the business by herself once \u2014 on the day she signed the contract. The next two days, she returned with a different man who appears to be Alex Cox, Daybell\u2019s brother. His silver pickup truck is observed at Self Storage Plus on camera multiple times during October.\n\nClick here for the entire story: https://www.eastidahonews.com/2020/02/lori-daybell-abandoned-a-storage-unit-in-rexburg-full-of-childrens-items/",

Investigators tell EastIdahoNews.com the couple has continually lied about the kids\u2019 whereabouts and they refuse to cooperate.\n\nRELATED | The major players and timeline of events in the disappearance of J.J. Vallow and Tylee Ryan\n\nMadison County Prosecutor Rob Wood filed a child protection order Saturday on behalf of 17-year-old Tylee and 7-year-old J.J. Child protection actions are normally confidential and sealed to protect the anonymity of the parties, but a court order allowed Wood to admit to the existence of the document and release a few details.\n\nWood and the Rexburg Police Department declined to comment Thursday on Daybell\u2019s failure to comply with the order and the mother could now be held in contempt of court. A judge could issue an arrest warrant, but it\u2019s likely the public will not immediately know what steps will be taken next.\n\n\u201CWhile the court did allow us to announce the existence of the case and the order that Lori Vallow produce her children, any and all other documents, hearings, and court filings are sealed and confidential by law,\u201D Wood said in a statement Wednesday. \u201CAs such we legally cannot comment on any other aspect of the case.\u201D\n\nWhile Lori and Chad failed to appear in Rexburg Thursday, J.J.\u2019s grandparents, Kay and Larry Woodcock, traveled from Louisiana in hopes of seeing the children.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019ve had a really rough few weeks and then once we learned about the order being given to her Saturday, that really gave us more hope that at least we\u2019re now seeing things happening,\u201D Woodcock tells EastIdahoNews.com.\n\nThe grandmother says she suspected the Daybells were in Hawaii as the state is Lori\u2019s \u201Cfavorite place on earth\u201D but she wasn\u2019t sure until EastIdahoNews.com confronted them Sunday afternoon after they were served with search warrants from the Kauai Police Department.\n\nWoodcock hopes that Lori will now be arrested and brought to Madison County for defying the court order.\n\n\u201CI would like for her to be in jail until she talks,\u201D Woodcock says. \u201CIf that\u2019s a month or a year or whatever the situation, she needs to be there until she talks. She\u2019s got to say where they are. She has to.\u201D\n\nThe case of the missing children has attracted international attention, particularly since Sunday when the couple was located in Hawaii. Over a dozen news outlets attended a press conference in Rexburg Thursday evening where Woodcock expressed her frustration at the Daybell\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201CHow do you not have your child for four months? What kind of a mother does that? The only word that is coming to my mind right now is \u2018monster\u2019 and as much as I loved Lori\u2026all this has just been very disheartening and I have so many questions,\u201D Woodcock said.\n\nAs Rexburg Police decide how to move forward on the missing children\u2019s case, Fremont County Sheriff Len Humphries tells EastIdahoNews.com his office is still awaiting the autopsy results on Tammy Daybell, Chad\u2019s first wife. She died in her sleep in October and investigators have classified her death as suspicious. Humphries does not know when the autopsy will be complete.",

      "description": "KAUAI, Hawaii \u2014 When Steve Latham meets most of his new neighbors, they\u2019re thrilled to be moving into the beautiful Villas on the Prince. The gated community of townhouse condos is located on the Prince Golf Course in Princeville, Kauai and is surrounded by palm trees, walking trails, beautiful fountains and a large swimming pool.\n\nLatham has lived here ten years and is a realtor with Oceanfront Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. He meets a lot of people and when Chad and Lori Daybell moved two houses down from him early last month, he had an interesting encounter.\n\n\u201CAbout the first week of December, there were some boxes left on their porch and I believe they were from Idaho,\u201D Latham recalls. \u201CI called the realtor that had the listing and he told me to put them inside. A few days after that, I saw them pull up and I went over and introduced myself. Their names were Chad and Lori.\u201D\n\nRELATED | Chad and Lori Daybell have been in Hawaii for a month in gated million-dollar community\n\nThe couple was polite but seemed \u201Cguarded,\u201D according to Latham. They didn\u2019t open up or share anything about their personal lives but thanked their new neighbor for bringing in their 3-4 heavy packages.\n\nThe unit was for sale and had been vacant for some time. The Daybells did not purchase the home, according to Latham, but signed a contract as long-term tenants. Many homes in the community are used for vacation rentals, but Chad and Lori had more permanent plans. Latham says they purchased furniture and had it moved in.\n\nBut then, they vanished.\n\n\u201CI don\u2019t think I ever saw them at the pool or anything like that. It seemed vacant most of the time. I didn\u2019t see lights on or anything like that,\u201D he says. \u201CI hardly ever saw them at all and I never saw them with anybody else so I don\u2019t know if they were living there or not.\u201D\n\nLatham had no idea Lori\u2019s children, Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 17, have been missing since the end of September. He did not know Lori and Chad were newlyweds and that Lori\u2019s ex-husband, Charles Vallow, was shot and killed in Arizona by Lori\u2019s brother, Alex Cox, last summer. Cox died of an undisclosed cause around the same time Chad and Lori moved to Hawaii.\n\nLatham was also unaware Chad\u2019s former wife, Tammy Daybell, died suspiciously in her sleep in October.\n\nThe realtor doesn\u2019t remember the last time he saw Lori Daybell but he had a brief conversation with Chad last Friday, Jan. 24. The Idaho father told Latham he was leaving because the condo was scheduled to be shown to a potential buyer.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Daybells served with search warrants in Hawaii\n\nTwo days later, the couple was stopped 16 miles south of the Princeville home at the Kauai Beach Resort. Kauai Police issued a search warrant on their rental SUV and on the residence two doors down from Latham\u2019s. Federal law enforcement and officers from eastern Idaho were also on hand.\n\n\u201COur role here on Kauai has been mostly to support and provide logistical help,\u201D Kahai County Prosecuting Attorney Justin Kollar says. \u201CThey\u2019re not currently suspected of committing any crimes here in Hawaii so our goal has been mainly to assist the mainland authorities and the state and federal authorities.\u201D\n\nLori Vallow Daybell lived in Hawaii with Charles Vallow years ago and they ran a juice bar. She has visited frequently but Kollar says his office was unaware of who she was until they were contacted by Madison County Prosecutor Rob Wood a few weeks ago.\n\n\u201CThis was not a person who was ever on our radar screen before this situation ever came up,\u201D Kollar says. \u201CAnything we can do here to hopefully find out where these kids are or what happened to them, we\u2019d be happy to do.\u201D\n\nRead the entire story at EastIdahoNews.com.",

Besides the search warrants, Lori Daybell was served with a court order Saturday demanding she have her children at the Rexburg Police Department or Idaho Department of Health and Welfare by Thursday or she could be arrested for being in contempt of court.\n\nSean Batholick, an attorney for Chad and Lori, told EastIdahoNews.com he had no comment on the latest developments.\n\nMore on the Daybell case\n\nIt\u2019s not clear exactly why authorities chose now to approach the Daybells. Fremont County Sheriff Len Humphries did confirm the timing of the warrants had nothing to do with the investigation into the death of Tammy Daybell, Chad\u2019s former wife.\n\nOn Sunday, some media agencies reported Chad Daybell\u2019s family had been given a copy of Tammy\u2019s autopsy report. However, Humphries says the autopsy results are still pending, and that no one has seen them.\n\nRELATED: The major players and timeline of events in the disappearance of JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan\n\nLori\u2019s former sister-in-law, Kay Woodcock, says she had guessed the Daybells were in Hawaii but was not sure until she saw video of EastIdahoNews.com approaching them at the Kauai Beach Resort.\n\nIt is Lori\u2019s favorite place on the island, according to Woodcock, and in February 2019, Lori and Tylee checked into the resort after Charles Vallow, Lori\u2019s husband, filed for divorce. They stayed for around a month, according to resort workers, and then returned to the mainland.\n\nWoodcock was surprised when she learned last summer that Lori was moving to Rexburg.\n\n\u201CShe is a very cold-natured person. When she moved to Idaho, I thought that was extremely unusual because if it\u2019s below 80 degrees, she\u2019s cold. She\u2019s got a jacket on,\u201D Woodcock tells EastIdahoNews.com.\n\nAfter Lori and Chad were served with warrants Sunday, they refused to answer questions posed by EastIdahoNews.com for nearly three minutes. Lori carried the warrant in her hand along with a gallon sized Ziploc bag containing a wad of cash.\n\n\u201CMaybe they were headed to the airport to get out,\u201D Woodcock says, wondering if suitcases were in their vehicle.\n\nThe Daybells kept a low profile on Kauai on Monday, but many people on the island were discussing the case after EastIdahoNews.com\u2019s video went viral and multiple news agencies around the world aired the footage.\n\nWoodcock and her husband, Larry, booked airline tickets and will be in Rexburg later this week. They hope Lori Daybell shows up with Tylee and Joshua.\n\n\u201CThe only way we\u2019ve been able to get through this is we have very strong faith in God,\u201D Woodcock says. \u201CWe have a very strong support army of friends and family and everybody that has emailed or texted \u2013 plus perfect strangers that are so compassionate.\u201D",

      "description": "REXBURG \u2014 The grandparents of a missing Rexburg boy are offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of him and his 17-year-old sister.\n\nKay and Larry Woodcock announced the reward during a news conference Tuesday morning. Their grandson, 7-year-old Joshua \u201CJJ\u201D Vallow, and his sister, Tylee Ryan, were last seen in Rexburg in September.\n\nThe Woodcocks traveled from Lake Charles, Louisiana and spent Monday in eastern Idaho meeting with Rexburg police and the FBI for six hours. The grandparents say until somebody tells them differently, they believe JJ and Tylee are still alive.\n\n\u201CThese are beautiful young children. They\u2019re two extremely intelligent young children and we want them back. We want them back in our family,\u201D Larry Woodcock said. \u201CWe don\u2019t say the \u2018D word.\u2019 We don\u2019t want to and we\u2019re not going to because we truly believe and we hope and pray these kids are alive.\u201D\n\nThe Woodcocks are the biological grandparents of JJ, who was adopted by Kay\u2019s brother, Charles Vallow. Charles was married to Lori Vallow Daybell. Police are calling Lori and her new husband, Chad Daybell, \u201Cpersons of interest\u201D in connection with the children\u2019s disappearance. Investigators say the couple has repeatedly told lies about the kids and that Lori knows where they are or what happened to them.\n\nDuring the news conference, the grandparents said they do not know where Chad and Lori are and made an appeal to the children\u2019s mother. They said she always had the \u201Cbest interest at heart for JJ\u201D until things slowly began changing two years ago.\n\n\u201CIf there is anything that Lori can come forth with and help us, please do it,\u201D Larry Woodcock said. \u201CShe knows how much we love these kids and we want only the best for them. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s that simple. Please give them back to us.\u201D\n\nThe Woodcocks often spoke with JJ and say he loved to Facetime with them. The last conversation with their grandson on Aug. 10 was less than a minute. Since then, they\u2019ve tried to contact him repeatedly.\n\n\u201CWe don\u2019t know why we weren\u2019t allowed more access to him but we reached out constantly in every way \u2013 email, voicemail, text, phone call, whatever \u2013 and never, ever got a response so that was very concerning to us,\u201D Kay Woodcock said.\n\nJJ loves to swim and is hardly afraid of anything in life, Larry Woodcock said. Tylee is a typical teenage girl who graduated early from high school and has a close group of friends.\n\nThe grandparents have launched the Find JJ and Tylee website in hopes of receiving tips from the public. They support law enforcement\u2019s effort to bring JJ and Tylee home and hope their reward will help.\n\n\u201CAll I want before I go is just to see those children,\u201D Larry Woodcock said. \u201CI just want to hear him beat on the drums, I want to hear him say, \u2018Papa, let\u2019s go ride\u2019 or \u2018Let\u2019s go to Checkers and let\u2019s go get a hamburger. I\u2019m hoping beyond hope that that happens in the near future.\u201D\n\nAnyone with information regarding the whereabouts of the children is asked to contact the Rexburg Police Department at (208) 359-3000, or the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) at (800) THE-LOST.",
