In this week\u2019s episode of What The Food, we tuck into history\u2019s most deranged cult diets, from the jungle gruel of Jonestown, to Heaven\u2019s Gate\u2019s death-by-pudding, to the one-grain-a-day enlightenment plan of Aum Shinrikyo. How do cults use food to control people? Why are so many of them obsessed with purification? And can you really find God on a 500-calorie salad? Join us as we rank the worst of the worst in a roundtable food fight no one asked for, and uncover why the road to salvation is often paved with beige, boiled suffering. Trigger warning: This episode contains dark themes including starvation, coercion, and mass death, but we\u2019ll hold your hand through it with our usual dose of British humour and sarcasm.
