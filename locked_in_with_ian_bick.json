      "title": "Inside a Cult: Ex NXIVM Member Reveals How He Escaped \u0026 Took Down the Leader | Anthony \u201CNippy\u201D Ames",
      "description": "Anthony \u0022Nippy\u0022 Ames, a former college athlete and aspiring actor, became involved with NXIVM, an organization that presented itself as a self-improvement group. Over 12 years, he advanced within NXIVM, becoming a teacher and establishing centers in New York and Vancouver. He met his wife, Sarah Edmondson, through the organization. Upon discovering NXIVM\u0027s illicit activities, Ames took decisive action to expose the group\u0027s misconduct. He played a pivotal role in dismantling NXIVM, contributing to the arrest and conviction of its leader, Keith Raniere, who received a 120-year prison sentence. Ames and Edmondson co-host the podcast \u0022A Little Bit Culty,\u0022 where they discuss their experiences and engage with fellow survivors and experts. #NXIVMCult #InsideACult #KeithRaniere #CultSurvivor #TrueCrime #MindControl #EscapingACult #JusticeServed Thank you to ROCKET MONEY for sponsoring today\u2019s episode!: Cancel your unwanted subscriptions and reach your financial goals faster with Rocket Money.
