Then we have a brief chat about what we\u0027ve been reading and watching and doing. Side note: We were drinking Boba Tea while recording, so apologies for the slurping noises. Our next book is \u0022Hell\u0027s Half Acre: The Untold Story of the Benders, a Serial Killer Family on the American Frontier\u0022 by Susan Jonusas, which we will discuss in episode 16.
