      "description": "Four siblings who survived the infamous Children of God cult join us for a powerful and deeply personal conversation. They share what it was like growing up inside the cult, how they found the strength to escape, and how those experiences continue to shape their lives today. We also explore the complex dynamics of their relationship with their parents and the road to healing after trauma.
