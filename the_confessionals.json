      "description": "In Episode 317: Satanic Panic and MK Ultra, we have the pleasure of speaking with Matt, a member of the Quinney family. The Quinney family went through hell when their father, Melvin Quinney, was wrongfully accused and convicted of being a satanic cult leader who abused children. Matt shares with us how the events unfolded, how he and his siblings found out the truth about their father, and what they are doing now to exonerate Melvin. During our conversation, Matt also discusses his mother\u0027s mental illness, which played a part in his father being locked away for many years. As he reveals more details about his mother, the topic of MK Ultra surfaces and will leave you wondering if the Quinneys\u0027 unfortunate situation stems from an even darker origin. Matt\u0027s conversation extends over a two parts, first as a public episode (Episode 317), and also as an Overtime episode. Please pray for Tony\u0027s wife, Lindsay, as she battles breast cancer. Your prayers make a difference!

      "description": "In episode 702: Surviving A Doomsday Cult, Jon, from The 21CD Podcast, and his brother AJ revisit a haunting chapter of their past; a childhood on remote land under the influence of a mystifying figure who seemed determined to shape their family\u2019s beliefs. Isolated from the outside world, they found themselves woven into strange rituals and kept under strict rules that made their lives feel increasingly unreal. Now, they reveal what it was like to grow up in a hidden cult and share stories that have never been told before. The experience changed them, but their search for answers didn\u2019t end there. Years later, a journey to Iceland brought them face-to-face with something that was so shocking, they couldn\u0027t believe it. During a late-night hike through an ancient landscape, shadowy figures moved on the cliffs above them, blending folklore with bone-chilling reality. In this episode, they share their tales of life on the edge of two worlds, the real and the supernatural.

      "description": "In this emotionally charged episode, Tony hosts Taylor and Tami, a son and mother duo with a story that unfolds layers of family secrets, supernatural experiences, and a harrowing journey through darkness. Beginning with light-hearted exchanges about personal quirks and shared memories, the conversation quickly veers into the depths of their family\u0027s history, entangled with a religious cult known as \u0022The Truth.\u0022 As the narrative progresses, Taylor shares his move to Florida to pursue professional wrestling, only to return home to Albuquerque amidst his mother\u0027s divorce from a prominent politician, unraveling a series of events that would forever alter their lives.\n\nThe story takes a darker turn as Tami and Taylor get into their family\u0027s entanglement with the cult, culminating in a chilling confrontation with what they describe as pure demonic evil. Taylor\u0027s aspirations and his mother\u0027s escape from the cult\u0027s grasp serve as a backdrop to a broader discussion on faith, redemption, and the fight against an unseen malevolence that threatens to consume their lives. Through their account, they explore themes of betrayal, the quest for identity, and the power of resilience in the face of unimaginable horror. This episode is a gripping tale of survival, a testament to the strength of the human spirit, and a profound reflection on the nature of evil and the possibility of hope in darkness.\n\nJoin this channel to get exclusive content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/TheConfessionalsPodcast/join\n\nThe Confessionals Members App:\nApple Store: https://apple.co/3UxhPrh\nGoogle Play: https://bit.ly/43mk8kZ\n\nBecome a member for AD FREE listening and EXTRA shows: theconfessionalspodcast.com/join\n\nWatch The Shape of Shadows: https://www.merkel.media/stream-now\nWatch Expedition Dogman: https://bit.ly/3CE6Kg0\n\nAFFILIATES\nPrepare with Valley Food Storage: https://alnk.to/2uG55AO\nGet your Nephilim Blaster 2000: https://alnk.to/9mnHak1\nBluecosmo Satellite phones: https://alnk.to/e769Eip\nSee Bigfoot with Sionyx night vision: https://alnk.to/bEhxr3F\nEmergency medical with My Medic: https://alnk.to/dpr6QM4\nBlack Beard Fire Starters: https://alnk.to/4BFcIbe\nEcoFlow Power Generators: https://alnk.to/flvpAQw\nGoDark Faraday Bags: https://alnk.to/5jke3rk\nEMP Shield: empshield.com Coupon Code: \u0022tony\u0022 for $50 off every item you purchase!\n\nSPONSORS\nFACTOR MEALS: factormeals.com/confessionals50\nSIMPLISAFE TODAY: simplisafe.com/confessionals\nHello Fresh: hellofresh.com/confessionalsfree Promo Code: \u0022confessionalsfree\u0022 for FREE BREAKFAST FOR LIFE!!!\n\nCONNECT WITH US\nWebsite: www.theconfessionalspodcast.com\nEmail: contact@theconfessionalspodcast.com\nSubscribe to the Newsletter: https://www.theconfessionalspodcast.com/the-newsletter\n\nMAILING ADDRESS:\nMerkel Media\n257 N.
