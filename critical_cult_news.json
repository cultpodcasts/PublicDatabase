      "description": "Tonight we premiere our first Critical Cult News show - a weekly live show premiering for members only, covering 3-5 news stories per week dealing with cults and coercive control. Tonight, we cover the Kenyan cult leader Paul Mackenzie, a North Carolina business in trouble for forcing employees to pray and a New York cult hiding in plain sight.\n\nThis being our first episode and the graphic layout leaving a lot to be desired, I am going to apologize for that and let you know next week\u0027s show will visually be a lot clearer.\n\nA full transcript of the news portion of this show is available on my website at https://mncriticalthinking.com\n\nSources:\n=========\nKenya Cult Leader Paul Mackenzie\n\nhttps://nation.africa/kenya/counties/kilifi/unmasking-paul-nthenge-the-preacher-linked-to-children-s-death--4171918\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-65412822\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/kenya-cult-deaths-mackenzie-grave-doomsday-2f296b2fa239097d6397179a1a37338d\n\nhttps://baptistnews.com/article/kenyas-latest-cult-tragedy-highlights-a-deeper-problem-with-religious-worship-in-africa/\n\nhttps://www.voanews.com/a/kenyans-consider-regulations-on-religion-as-cult-members-bodies-exhumed/7216067.html\n\nhttps://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2022-11-10-malindi-town-has-been-around-for-centuries/\n\nEnforced Prayer at Work\n\nhttps://lawandcrime.com/lawsuit/home-repair-company-employees-fired-for-refusing-to-attend-cult-like-prayer-meetings-receive-large-settlement/\n\nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-sues-aurora-pro-services-religious-discrimination\n\nhttps://www.cbs17.com/news/north-carolina-news/nc-home-repair-company-must-pay-50000-settlement-after-lawsuit-over-cult-like-prayer-meetings/\n\nThe Sullivanians\n\nhttps://www.insidehook.com/article/books/alexander-stille-sullivanians-new-book-interview-commune\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/the-upper-west-side-cult-that-hid-in-plain-sight\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_B._Newton\n\nPROTEST SCIENTOLOGY WEBSITE:\nhttps://protestscientology.com\nPromo code: CRITICAL\n\nCHRIS\u0027S LINKTREE (ALL SOCIAL/SUPPORT LINKS)\nhttps://linktr.ee/chrissheltonmsc\n\nCRITICAL CLIPS CHANNEL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/CriticalClips\n\nSHOP FOR CRITICAL MERCHANDISE\nhttp://shop.spreadshirt.com/chrisshelton\n\nMy book, Scientology: A to Xenu, is available here:\nPaperback: https://goo.gl/yYIl2t\nKindle edition: http://goo.gl/K51ySi\nAudio edition: http://goo.gl/1yvlYS\n\nSubscribe to my podcast at http://sensiblyspeaking.com or on iTunes at https://goo.gl/1QDUHS\n\nPlease consider supporting this channel and helping me to offer more and better content. \nVenmo: @shelton1492\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/chrisshelton\nPayPal: https://paypal.me/ChrisJShelton\nClick the blue Support button here: https://goo.gl/vHgSoE\n\nMusic from #Uppbeat (free for Creators!):\nhttps://uppbeat.io/t/mood-maze/cybertruck\nLicense code: O14M0EPN9TEPA1OG",
