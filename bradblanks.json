      "description": "Back in 2001 while sitting on a couch in London awaiting the call up to New York City radio I watched a lot of Louis Theroux and his 2nd show \u0022When Louis Met.....\u0022 From this video you can tell I was a dash excited to meet one of the greatly understated (and very funny!) documentarians walking around today. His new movie is called \u0022My Scientology Movie\u0022 and it\u0027s a wild adventure into that very controlled world. Hope you enjoy the chat......  \nwww.bradblanks.com\nwww.facebook.com/bradblankspage\nwww.twitter.com/bradblanks\nWww.instagram.com/bradblanks\nSNAPCHAT bradblanksnyc",
