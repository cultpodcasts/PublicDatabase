      "description": "Watch these episodes a week early on Nebula when you sign up for Curiosity Stream at http://www.curiositystream.com/joescottpod\nDr. Janja Lalich is a world-renowned expert on cults. Not only has she studied the subject for more than 30 years, she was once in a cult herself. In today\u0027s conversation, she tells her story and discusses how the weird times we\u0027re living in are not just fertile ground for cults, but seems to be creating a whole new kind of cult - one with wide-ranging implications for society.\n\n=================\n\nFollow this podcast in your favorite podcast player, where I post a week early:\nSpotify \uD83D\uDC49 https://spoti.fi/37iPGzF\nApple Podcasts \uD83D\uDC49 https://apple.co/3j94kfq\nGoogle Podcasts \uD83D\uDC49 https://bit.ly/3qZCo1V\n\nYou can also follow my other channels:\nAnswers With Joe:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/joescott\n\nJoe Scott TMI:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqi721JsXlf0wq3Z_cNA_Ew\n\nWanna help keep this podcast going?
