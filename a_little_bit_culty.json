And yes, we\u2019re still waiting on that Ghislaine Maxwell client list.\n This one\u2019s about gaslighting disguised as growth, friendships forged in the fire, and the red flags that just kept waving.

      "description": "This episode is sponsored in part by Betterhelp. This week our guest is Rachael Reign, a survivor of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God (UCKG). At just 13, Rachael was swept into UCKG\u2019s world of fire and brimstone \u2013 where teenage exorcisms were a weekly ritual, your mental health struggles meant demons were lurking inside you, and giving your last cent to the church wasn\u2019t just encouraged \u2013 it was demanded. She shares how she went from being a bright, curious teenager to a youth group leader tasked with recruiting others, cleaning the church floorboards with her tears, and enduring violent \u201Cstrong prayers\u201D that left her bruised, broken, and questioning her sanity. Behind the gospel music and shiny sermons was a cult built on fear, shame, and draining its members dry in the name of salvation. Rachael doesn\u2019t hold back as she unpacks the manipulative recruitment tactics, the psychological torment disguised as faith, and the way UCKG weaponized scripture to justify abuse and financial exploitation. She also takes us through her escape \u2013 losing everything she knew, only to rebuild from the ashes into an advocate fighting for cult survivors and legal reform in the UK. Because when your church tells you to give God everything, what they really mean is: give it to us \u2013 your money, your body, your mind, your freedom.

Whatever label you stick on Sarma Melngailis, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s not done telling her side of the story \u2013 and we\u2019re here for it.\n In Part 2 of our chat, Sarma gets even realer about life after Mr. Fox. From the mind games that taught her to dissociate, to her self-diagnosed matrix moments, she opens up about rebuilding her identity in a world that still sees her as a headline villain. She talks dating post-trauma, the healing power of alone time (cue: tears, journals, and EFT tapping), and why her business decisions now come with a hefty dose of pause and reflect.\n Plus, Sarma shares why she walked away from partnerships that didn\u2019t vibe, her hot takes on the \u201Cnon-reactivity\u201D cult trend, and what Bad Vegan got oh-so-wrong about her. Spoiler: it\u2019s a lot.\n For more on Sarma, you can find her on Instagram @sarmamelngailis, on her website sarmaraw.com, or on Patreon at patreon.com/sarmasarma.

      "description": "Raw vegan queen turned Netflix \u201Cvillain\u201D? In this episode, we sit down with Sarma Melngailis \u2013 yes, Bad Vegan Sarma \u2013 to get the real story behind the headlines. She\u2019s back for her third culty chat, this time with the exclusive on her brand-new memoir The Girl with the Duck Tattoo (don\u2019t worry, we ask her about the title). Sarma dives into the psychological warfare that turned her life upside down: coercive control, gaslighting, and a manipulative Mr. Fox who left her broke, arrested, and widely misunderstood. She opens up about the pain (and relief) of telling it all, what the Netflix doc twisted, and why she\u2019s reclaiming her narrative \u2013 duck tattoo and all. This one\u2019s raw, redemptive, and a stark reminder: not every headline villain is the real bad guy.

We\u0027re also joined by Lisa Bilyeu, host of Women of Impact \u0026 queen of calling out BS wherever it lurks. Dr. Laura breaks down how cult leaders, predators, \u0026 power-hungry narcissists (looking at you, Sean Combs) use tactics straight out of the coercive control playbook to groom, manipulate, \u0026 dominate victims. We\u0027re talking about how the \u0027nice guy\u0027 veneer slowly erodes, why women like Christina Corom end up as right-hand enforcers, \u0026 why media still struggles to call out abusive power structures for what they are. We also get into: \u2022 Why grooming is always strategic, never accidental \u2022 The eerie parallels between Keith Raniere, Sean Combs, \u0026 other culty figures \u2022 The hidden dangers of female lieutenants like Nancy Salzman, Ghislaine Maxwell, \u0026 Christina Coram \u2022 How to spot coercive control before it becomes your entire world It\u0027s a masterclass in manipulation, \u0026 a reminder that cult tactics aren\u0027t confined to creepy compounds in Upstate New York.

      "description": "Long before kale smoothies went mainstream, The Source Family was seducing Hollywood with vegan food, free love, and a guru who called himself Father Yod. This wasn\u2019t just LA\u2019s first vegan restaurant \u2013 it was a commune where long-haired devotees in white robes took ice-cold showers at dawn, meditated for hours, and followed strict spiritual rules under their bearded leader. Celebrities like John Lennon and Cher might have stopped by for a meal, but for many teen girls \u2013 often runaways \u2013 this place became home, for better or worse.\n Wendy Baker was one of those girls. At 14, she left a traumatic childhood behind for promises of love and enlightenment. Renamed Mushroom, she was swept into a life of chanting, raw vegan meals, and devotion to Father Yod. By sixteen, she had her first child; by nineteen, she was ready to escape.\n In this episode, Wendy shares what life was really like in the Source Family \u2013 from malnutrition and sleep deprivation to the ego-shaming that kept members silent. She talks about her journey out, her marriage to Bart, Father Yod\u2019s son, and how writing her memoir, My Name Was Mushroom, helped her heal.\n For more on Wendy\u2019s journey, check out her website and memoir My Name Was Mushroom.\n Trigger warning: This episode discusses childhood trauma, underage relationships, and cult manipulation.\n \u00A0\n Also\u2026 let it be known that:\n The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

      "description": "This week, we\u2019re back with Harvard professor and author Rebecca Lemov to finish what we started: unraveling the tangled web of brainwashing\u2026past, present, and disturbingly future-facing. In Part 2, we go deeper into the CIA\u2019s infamous MK Ultra program and its many (many) spin-offs, asking what really went down with Charles Manson, Jack Ruby, and cult \u201Cconsultant\u201D Louis Jolyon West. From LSD to hypnosis to rebranding your science after burning the files, the government\u2019s experiments in mind control were both extreme and incredibly hush-hush. We also explore how classic brainwashing tactics, like Milieu Control and loaded language, haven\u2019t gone away; they\u2019ve just been re-skinned for the algorithm era. Think social media rabbit holes, crypto trading cults, and belief systems that sound more like start-up pitches than spiritual awakenings. Plus, we talk trauma: how it\u2019s misunderstood, under-acknowledged, and all too often the gateway drug into high-control groups. If you thought last week was unsettling, buckle up.

      "description": "This week, we\u0027re diving deep into the mind games with Harvard professor \u0026 author Rebecca Lemov, because if you\u0027ve ever wondered whether brainwashing is real, the answer is a very unsettling yes. In Part 1 of our convo, we\u0027re cracking open the origins of brainwashing\u2014from communist re-education camps to the electric shock labs of the Milgram experiment\u2014and asking why we still can\u0027t seem to prove it in court. Rebecca\u0027s new book, The Instability of Truth, peels back the layers of mind control \u0026 thought reform, including what went down with Patty Hearst, why Stockholm Syndrome isn\u0027t what you think it is, \u0026 how emotional trauma becomes the secret sauce in cult programming. We also get personal. NXIVM, anyone? The parallels between modern-day cults \u0026 Maoist \u0027unity-criticism-unity\u0027 techniques are downright eerie... \u0026 maybe uncomfortably familiar. From groupthink to gaslighting to re-grounding in a new belief system, this episode might just mess with your head a little (in a good way). Trigger warning: once you see the matrix, it\u0027s hard to unsee it. Find more about Rebecca Lemov and The Instability of Truth at rebeccalemov.com (https://rebeccalemov.com) .

With $100M\u002B in revenue, instructors trained like pop stars, and a tightly curated sense of belonging (read: exclusivity), SoulCycle pedaled its way into cultural obsession\u2014and, depending on who you ask, cult status.\n Jess, a former SoulCycle instructor and host of the GLAAD-nominated Finding Fire Island and new docu-podcast Cult of Body \u0026 Soul, joins us to unpack the seductive psychology of the SoulCycle experience: from spiritual monologues to the sweaty transference happening mid-sprint. We talk about limerence, manipulation, performance, and yes, the merch.\n Whether you\u2019re a front-row devotee or just cult-curious, this ride gets personal.\n \n For more from Jess, check out her podcasts  Hot Takes \u0026 Deep Dives and Cult of Body \u0026 Soul, or follow her on Instagram @jessxnyc.\n \n Also\u2026 let it be known that:\n The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

      "description": "We\u2019re back with Part 2 of our conversation with Jane Borden, author of Cults Like Us, where we pick up right where we left off \u2013 with the Puritans, of course. Because what\u2019s more American than a doomsday cult in denial? In this half, we explore how their legacy of moral perfectionism, isolationism, and a rigid \u201Cus vs. them\u201D worldview continues to shape American institutions, politics, and even pop psychology. Jane takes us through the cult wars of the \u201980s and \u201990s, the rise of deprogrammers and cult apologists, and the influence of Large Group Awareness Trainings (aka LGATs) like EST and Landmark on today\u2019s self-help landscape. We also dive into the concept of normative dissonance, how political architects like Newt Gingrich exploited division for power, and why bridging social gaps might be the antidote to modern-day culty chaos. Along the way, Jane reminds us why humor can be a powerful tool for understanding even the darkest parts of our culture. If you missed Part 1, hit pause and go back. We promise it\u2019s worth it!

Jane Borden is a journalist and the author of Cults Like Us: Why Doomsday Thinking Drives America. In Part 1 of this two-part conversation, she joins us to unpack how Puritan beliefs\u2014think apocalypse prepping, chosen nation syndrome, and the worship of wealth\u2014laid the groundwork for the kind of culty thinking that still thrives in America today. We dig into the legacy of American exceptionalism, the allure of authoritarian leaders, and the ways our pop culture heroes reflect Puritan values more than we realize. Jane also walks us through the tragic case of the Love Has Won cult and explains how power warps empathy, especially when paired with a doomsday mindset. It\u2019s a wild ride through history, psychology, and politics, with heavy cult undertones.

      "description": "This week on A Little Bit Culty, we\u2019re getting a little mystical\u2014with our eyes wide open. Historian and occult scholar Mitch Horowitz joins us to explore the space where spirituality meets personal growth, and how easily it can slip into culty territory. His latest book, Practical Magick: Ancient Tradition and Modern Practice , helps make sense of mystical ideas while encouraging intentional belief. We dig into the red flags to watch for on the seeker\u2019s path, from peer pressure and time abuse to isolation and guru worship. We also talk about money, emotion, and how performance culture can sneak into spiritual spaces. Mitch makes the case for private exploration, critical thinking, and walking away when something doesn\u2019t feel right. Whether you\u2019re deep into the woo or just woo-adjacent, this one\u2019s packed with insight on how to stay curious without giving your power away.

This time, Tammy walks us through what finally pushed her family to leave the Twelve Tribes, including a hollow diet, some serious double standards, and a clandestine late-night escape from their Florida commune.\n \n\nShe shares what it\u2019s like to rejoin the outside world after years of being told it was evil (spoiler: it\u2019s weird), how Rite Aid and a bag of Hershey\u2019s Kisses helped rewire her brain, and what healing looks like when you\u2019re doing it for both yourself and your kids.\n \n\nWe also talk about her book, All Who Believed (https://www.tamaramathieu.com/) , part memoir, part survival manual, for anyone trying to make sense of life after leaving a high-control group.\n \n\nIf you missed Part 1, hit pause and go back.

      "description": "This episode is sponsored in part by Betterhelp.\n Twelve Tribes started as a Bible study in the 1970s. Today, it\u2019s a nationwide network of high-control communities, often hiding in plain sight behind the homespun charm of Yellow Deli caf\u00E9s. The group claims to offer a simpler, more spiritual life. But behind the braided bread and \u201Cfamily values\u201D lies a world of control, corporal punishment, and deep-rooted misogyny.\n In Part 1 of our conversation with Tamara Mathieu, we hear what it\u2019s like to live inside. Tammy spent 14 years in the Twelve Tribes, lured in by the promise of community and stability at a vulnerable time in her life. But what began as a warm welcome quickly turned into an authoritarian nightmare, especially for women and children. She shares how the group isolates members, enforces biblical patriarchy, and punishes dissent, and what it took to finally break free.\n To learn more about Tammy\u2019s journey, check out her memoir All Who Believed, a raw and powerful account of survival and escape.\n Also\u2026 let it be known that:\n The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

We also answer some big listener questions, from \u201CWould you have stayed in NXIVM if DOS never happened?\u201D to \u201CDid I just get kicked out of a culty improv troupe?\u201D It\u2019s a packed one.

      "description": "Can religion ruin your sex life? This week on A Little Bit Culty, Sarah and Nippy are joined by psychotherapists and certified sex therapists Jeremiah Gibson and Julia Pastima\u2014co-hosts of the podcast Sexvangelicals: The Sex Education the Church Didn\u2019t Want You to Have. Together, they explore how religion, especially purity culture and fundamentalist gender roles, can cause lasting damage to relationships and sexual well-being. From internalized shame to rigid scripts about gender and sex, Jeremiah and Julia explain how high-control religious environments affect intimacy long after someone leaves the faith. They also discuss the complexities of deconstructing religion as a couple, the importance of finding shared values, and why therapy can be a vital lifeline through it all. If you\u2019re trying to untangle your beliefs from your bedroom, this conversation offers both validation and guidance. This one\u2019s extra spicy, so listener discretion is advised.

In this week\u2019s episode, we chat with Amanda Rae, survivor of the infamous Kingston clan, a radical Mormon sect also known as \u201CThe Order.\u201D If you\u2019ve seen Escaping Polygamy on A\u0026E, you might recognize Amanda from the show, where she helped others flee the same secretive and abusive group she escaped at just 17. Amanda shares what it was like growing up in a world built on polygamy, incest, and \u201Cpure bloodlines\u201D\u2014including the pressure to marry her cousin, her father\u2019s multiple incestuous marriages, and the cult\u2019s obsession with racial purity. She walks us through the shocking inner workings of the Kingston clan: secret banks, isolation tactics, assigned marriages, and the terrifying consequences of trying to leave. This is the first half of Amanda\u2019s harrowing story of survival, recovery, and advocacy. Stay tuned for Part 2 later this week.

      "description": "We\u0027re back with Part 2 of our conversation with Dr. Mara Einstein, diving even deeper into the unsettling connections between cults, multi-level marketing (MLMs), higher education, \u0026 the digital world. In this episode, we unpack how MLMs use tactics like love bombing, upselling, \u0026 deception to recruit \u0026 retain members \u2014 \u0026 how these same strategies show up in places you might not expect, like college admissions \u0026 social media. Mara walks us through the financial \u0026 emotional tolls of higher education, the anxiety economy created by tech platforms, \u0026 the importance of protecting your data privacy in a world built to exploit it. With real-world examples \u0026 practical advice, this episode is packed with insights on how to stay critical, self-aware, \u0026 informed in the face of modern manipulation.

From influencer culture and MLMs to \u201Cbrand cults\u201D and rage farming, Mara breaks down how modern marketing preys on fear, insecurity, and our need to belong.\n She joins Sarah and Nippy for a deep-dive into the culty parallels between conversion funnels and recruitment tactics, why brands like Apple and Lululemon are more community than commerce, and how social media algorithms corral us into echo chambers where we become both the audience and the product.\n If you\u2019ve ever felt like your phone is reading your mind, or like the coaching industry is selling more promises than progress, this one\u2019s for you.\n This is Part 1 of a two-part convo.

      "description": "This episode is sponsored in part by BetterHelp. New Age isn\u0027t just sage bundles \u0026 Instagram affirmations. It can also be a fast track to conspiracy-laced belief systems, grifty gurus, \u0026 straight-up cults. In this episode, we\u0027re joined by journalist \u0026 podcaster Leah Sottile, whose new book Blazing Eye Sees All takes a sharp look at how New Age spirituality has seeped into American culture, \u0026 not always in ways that sparkle. We dig into the strange \u0026 disturbing world of Love Has Won, a New Age cult led by self-proclaimed deity Amy Carlson, aka Mother God, who gained infamy for turning blue from drinking colloidal silver. (Yes, really.) Leah breaks down how Carlson built a loyal following online, why her followers believed she channeled Robin Williams, \u0026 how the group continued after her death. We also talk about the deeper issues hiding behind the crystal curtains\u2014like why women are often drawn to New Age ideologies, the patriarchal dynamics hidden in so-called matriarchal cults, \u0026 the troubling rise of antisemitism in these belief systems. This one is equal parts fascinating \u0026 horrifying. Come for the blue lady, stay for the sharp insight.

      "description": "Alcoholics Anonymous has become a household name. You\u2019ve probably heard of the 12 steps, sponsors, and sobriety chips. At its best, AA can be life-changing. But in some chapters, things can take a darker turn, and when they do, there\u2019s no centralized structure to step in.\n In this episode, we\u2019re talking with April McLean\u2014a blogger and former member of AA who found herself deep in a high-control group that looked a lot like a cult. April bravely walks us through her journey across three different AA groups, where love bombing, spiritual shaming, and manipulation were passed off as \u201Ctough love.\u201D What started as a path to recovery became a minefield of emotional abuse, gaslighting, and coercive control.\n We explore what happens when sponsors exploit their position of power, how AA\u2019s decentralized model leaves members vulnerable, and why it\u2019s so important to listen to your gut when something feels off, even in a space that\u2019s supposed to help you heal.\n Trigger warning for addiction and alcohol abuse.\n Note: We\u2019re not here to bash AA as a whole\u2014it\u2019s helped a lot of people. But as April\u2019s story shows, it\u2019s possible for helpful frameworks to become harmful when the wrong people are in charge. If you\u2019re struggling with substance abuse or any mental health crisis, please call or text 988 to reach the Suicide \u0026 Crisis Lifeline.

Laura, who spent ten years at New Scotland Yard and helped establish the UK\u2019s coercive control laws, joins us again to unpack the ways power and control are used to manipulate, silence, and harm.\n This time, we dig into recent headlines involving Kanye West, Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, Britney Spears, and the Depp v. Heard trial. Laura explores the public\u2019s reaction to each case, exposing how gender bias and societal conditioning influence who we believe\u2014and who we dismiss.\n We also discuss how these patterns connect back to cults, Hollywood, and broader systems of manipulation. And since Laura\u2019s work centers around prevention, she asks Sarah and Nippy to reflect on what might have helped them exit NXIVM sooner.\n This episode includes a trigger warning for sexual assault, murder, and domestic abuse.\n If you haven\u2019t heard Part 1 yet, be sure to listen to that first.

      "description": "This episode is sponsored in part by Betterhelp. What do serial killers, cult leaders, and domestic abusers have in common? According to criminal behavior analyst Laura Richards, quite a lot. In this powerful conversation, Laura explains the concept of coercive control\u2014the psychological abuse tactic often at the core of these crimes\u2014and how it plays out across intimate relationships, cults, and high-profile cases. Laura spent a decade at New Scotland Yard investigating rape, murder, and abduction. She went on to found the Homicide Prevention Unit and Paladin, the world\u2019s first national stalking advocacy service. Her work helped reduce the murder rate in the UK by 58 percent and led to coercive control being criminalized there. Now, she\u2019s fighting for similar legal reforms in the U.S. In Part 1 of our conversation, Laura offers insight into the behaviors and warning signs she sees in the cases of Gabby Petito, Sean \u0022P. Diddy\u0022 Combs, \u201CDirty\u201D John Meehan, British serial killer Peter Sutcliffe, Larry Ray (of the Sarah Lawrence cult case), and NXIVM\u2019s Keith Raniere. This episode gives you a new lens for spotting red flags\u2014and a deeper understanding of how abusers manipulate power and control, so major trigger warning for sexual assault, murder, and domestic violence this week.

      "description": "This episode is sponsored in part by Betterhelp.\n \n\n Ishayas\u2019 Ascension\u2014also known as the Bright Path\u2014is a new-agey meditation movement that promises spiritual enlightenment through \u201Cstillness\u201D and expensive courses. But behind the soothing mantras and lofty ideals lurks a leader who demands total submission. Followers are taught that their thoughts, emotions, and even their sense of self aren\u2019t real\u2014only God is. What could possibly go wrong?\n Our guest today is Cristina Coello, who spent years deep inside the Bright Path under its guru, Maharishi Krishna Nanda. From 2018 to 2021, Cristina was an active teacher and organizer, drawn in by the promise of personal and collective healing. But as she became more involved, she witnessed firsthand the manipulative control tactics, gaslighting, and financial exploitation that kept members devoted. The turning point? Experiencing sexual harassment from the leader himself and the community\u2019s toxic response when she spoke out.\n In this episode, Cristina shares her journey\u2014from being drawn into the group\u2019s teachings to the painful process of leaving and rebuilding her life. We also discuss the dangers of dismissing mental health in spiritual spaces, the subtle ways cults dismantle personal identity, and the red flags to look out for when seeking a safe community.\n Find Cristina on Instagram, Facebook, Threads, and TikTok: @iamcristinacoello and her website at uncultedpodcast.com\n \u00A0\n Also\u2026 let it be known that:\n The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

      "description": "We\u2019re bringing you a spicy one today on ALBC! Our guest is Ariel Anderssen, a professional BDSM model and sex-positive author. Raised as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, Ariel grew up in a world where sexuality was strictly controlled, desire was equated with sin, and the end of the world was always just around the corner. But after leaving the faith, she embarked on a journey of self-discovery that led her to embrace kink, submission, and sexual liberation. In this episode, Ariel shares what it was like to grow up in a high-control religious group that dictated every aspect of her life, from what she could wear to how she could think. She opens up about the moment she realized she wasn\u2019t alone in her desires, the misconceptions people have about BDSM, and the surprising parallels between religious fundamentalism and the power dynamics in kink. We also get into feminism, consent, and the ongoing cultural battle over who gets to decide what is and isn\u2019t acceptable when it comes to sex. Today\u2019s episode gets a bit steamy, so consider yourself warned. If you want to learn more about Ariel\u2019s story, check out her memoir Playing to Lose: How a Jehovah\u2019s Witness Became a Submissive BDSM Model .

As a child of staff members, she was subjected to even harsher discipline, forced to navigate a world where \u0022The Mothers\u0022 ruled with an iron grip, friendships were forbidden, and obedience was demanded at all costs. In this first part of our conversation, Beth recounts her early years at Grenville, the cult-like tactics used to control students and staff, and the staggering legal battle that eventually led to the school\u0027s closure.

      "description": "What\u2019s it like to grow up in a world where your life\u2019s only purpose is to serve the men around you? Cait West knows firsthand. Raised in a household steeped in Christian patriarchy\u2014a radical movement that places men in absolute control over their families\u2014Cait was homeschooled, groomed to be an obedient wife and mother, and forbidden from pursuing a career or formal education. By the time she escaped at 25, she had no driver\u2019s license, no real job experience, and few resources to navigate life outside the confines of her upbringing. Despite all of that, Cait built a new life for herself. She\u2019s now a writer, podcaster, and the author of Rift: A Memoir of Breaking Away from Christian Patriarchy. She also co-hosts the podcast Survivors Discuss and serves on the editorial board of Tears of Eden , a nonprofit supporting survivors of spiritual abuse. In this episode, Cait shares her journey out of Christian patriarchy, unpacks the disturbing ideologies at its core, and talks about how she reclaimed her independence and sense of self. Be advised: this episode includes discussions of religious trauma, sexual trauma, and the movement\u2019s toxic views on race and gender. Cait\u2019s resilience is inspiring, and her story sheds light on the often-hidden realities of religious abuse. Don\u2019t miss this fascinating and deeply important conversation.

      "description": "This episode is brought to you in part by Squarespace. Head to https://www.squarespace.com/CULTY to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain using code CULTY. John Ramsey knows a lot about culty thinking within police investigations. He experienced it firsthand after his daughter, JonBen\u00E9t Ramsey, was murdered in 1996. JonBen\u00E9t was the six-year-old beauty queen found strangled and beaten to death in her Boulder, CO home. Despite DNA evidence pointing to an unknown male intruder, John and his family were the prime suspects for years, and they weren\u2019t officially exonerated until 2008. The inexperienced Boulder police department bungled this investigation from day one, but their tunnel-vision and group-think when it came to suspects might really be what thwarted justice. JonBen\u00E9t\u2019s case remains unsolved to this day. John Ramsey is here to discuss how culty mindsets and a lack of critical thinking can hamper police investigations. We get into the way his daughter\u2019s case was mishandled, how the police turned a blind eye to evidence that didn\u2019t fit the narrative, and how modern technology might finally solve this little girl\u2019s murder. Please note that what happened to JonBen\u00E9t is truly horrifying. Big trigger warning this week.

      "description": "Bringing you an extra special Part 2 for today\u0027s bonus episode with Jules Hartley. You may have heard of Kundalini yoga from its popularity with celebrities, but you might be less familiar with its culty history. Invented in the late 60s by a guru-turned-cult leader named Yogi Bhajan, Kundalini is an intensive form of yoga that weirdly uses breathing exercises to manipulate people. After its founder died in 2004, one of his followers, Guru Jagat, picked up where he left off. Jagat founded the Ra Ma Institute, which she ran more like a cult than a yoga studio. Our guest today, Jules Hartley, escaped Ra Ma in 2017. She\u2019s featured in the HBO docuseries \u201CBreath of Fire\u201D about the cult of Kundalini yoga. Jules is here to tell us about her experience with Guru Jagat, and we\u2019ll also get into the media\u2019s portrayal of cult survivors. Kundalini has an incredibly dark history that includes child and sexual abuse, so trigger warning this week.

      "description": "Author and podcaster Amanda Knox sits down with Sarah and Nippy to discuss the culty nature of the Italian justice system. Amanda shares how she was coerced by the police into confessing to a crime she did not commit and details her experience with a media that is more concerned with ratings than truth. She also discusses the ongoing process of healing from trauma and her ongoing work in criminal justice reform. Amanda\u2019s podcast, \u201CLabyrinths,\u201D explores the complexities of the justice system and the human stories often obscured by sensationalized headlines. She has also authored the best-selling memoir, \u201CWaiting to be Heard,\u201D offering a firsthand account of her ordeal. Amanda also continues to write and speak out with her new book, \u201CFree My Search for Meaning,\u201D scheduled for release in March 2025. In addition to her work on broader justice reform issues, Knox is also writing a book focusing on her complex and evolving relationship with Giuliano Mignini, the prosecutor who played a central role in her wrongful conviction.

It\u2019s no surprise, but anytime we mention diet, fitness, or nutrition, we hear about it in our DMs. There\u2019s some tension here, we know it, we see it, and we hear you. And it makes sense. In the world of health and diet, there\u2019s a lot of snake oil salesmen out here. The cult of nutrition is very real.\u00A0\n \u00A0\n Today\u2019s guest is a friend who is familiar with the false gurus that flock to the fitness space. Wade T. Lightheart is the co-founder of supplement brand BiOptimizers. We thought this chat would be a great way to answer questions we get all the time from our listeners. How do you know if you\u2019re buying into something healthy or just drinking snake oil? And is it just us, or have health and wellness trends become culty as hell? How do you cut through the noise to make the right choice for your health and wellness?

      "description": "Well, this is a first for us. Today, we\u2019re covering the Zion Society, which was a cult run by a landscaper, Arvin Shreeve. Based out of Ogden, Utah, Shreeve and his followers had some of the most manicured lawns in the neighborhood. But, behind lush green lawns hid sinister secrets. This polygamist sect had about 100 members at its peak, hiding in plain sight in a quiet suburban\u00A0 cul-de-sac. Former lieutenant Mike King was the one to discover them. With a tip from one of the former followers, Mike helped put Shreeve and many of his followers behind bars for life.\u00A0\n Mike King is the creator and host of Profiling Evil, a YouTube channel and podcast that covers breaking true crime stories, as well as the author of \u201CDeceived: An Investigative Memoir of the Zion Society Cult.\u201D We spoke to him this summer in front of a live audience at CrimeCon. Now, we\u2019re sharing it on our main feed. In this episode, we dive deep into the practices of the Zion Society and Mike\u2019s investigation that ultimately brought the cult down.\u00A0\n Also\u2026 let it be known that:\n The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

It follows Robert Shinn and his Los Angeles-based church, Shekinah, which has engaged some heavy-hitting social media stars to make a ton of money for his church. The families of those social media stars \u2014 who have been cut off from their loved ones by Shinn \u2014 think that Shekinah is a cult. And, well, we agree that it sure does seem a little culty. This week, we talked with Andrea Marks \u2014 a journalist who has covered both Robert Shinn and his church for Rolling Stone, and who spoke on camera in \u201CDancing for the Devil.\u201D Andrea Marks is a freelance journalist who has written for Rolling Stone, The New York Times, and many other outlets, where she covers crime and subculture. In this episode, we get into the lawsuits surrounding Shinn, the allegations of abuse, and how a social media-focused cult can thrive in the age of constant connection. Plus, Andrea touches on her time reporting on NXIVM.

Filmmaker Scott Homan\u2019s debut documentary feature \u201C\u0027Witness Underground\u201D,\u00A0 sheds light on the experiences, creative expressions, and defection of ex-members of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses community.\u00A0 The film delves into the journey of notable underground bands within the culty, culty JW organization, and chronicles their musical legacy comprising over 30 albums across multiple decades. Scott joins us today to talk about his experience coming of age as a second generation JW, and how he and other ex-JWs have harnessed the power of art for awakening and therapeutic purposes after escaping high-control religion.\u00A0\n \u00A0\n Shownotes:\n Filmmaker Scott Homan, was raised as a second generation Jehovah\u2019s Witness in Wisconsin where his teenage music community recorded albums while being influenced by the cult. He studied photography and digital media in Minneapolis and now runs Banana Island Films, which was born in a music community during his years in Hanoi, Vietnam. His present projects focus on artists escaping cults, demonstrating that self-expression through art shortens the path to healing from shunning. \u201CWitness Underground\u201D is his debut feature documentary, and as a wider project, includes the Witness Underground YouTube channel and the series \u201CXJW Coming Out.\u201D\n \u201CWitness Underground\u201D was just released on major streaming platforms, TUBI for free with ads, and on Amazon to rent or buy.\u00A0 Learn more at:\n WitnessUnderground.com\n \n TUBI: tubitv.com/movies/100018684/witness-underground\u00A0\n Amazon Prime Video:\u00A0 amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0CVGPPFZ\n To Rate and Review on IMDB:\u00A0 imdb.com/title/tt15215562\n \u00A0\n Also\u2026let it be known that:\n \n\n The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

      "description": "This epiosde is sponsored by Better Help. What does a thriving life look like after surviving a cult? Katherine Spearing has some ideas about that, and some real life experience to back those ideas up. She survived the cult of the The Christian Patriarchy Movement, also known as the Stay-At- Home-Daughter Movement. And yeah: That\u2019s as terrible as it sounds. The most prominent characteristic of this particular cult is that it requires adult daughters to stay home until they marry, serving their father in preparation for serving their husband. Raised in this environment meant that Katherine wasn\u2019t allowed to go to college, but she didn\u2019t let that stop her: She did it in secret: starting her first class at 25 years old. And flash forward to today: She\u2019s an author, a podcaster, an advocate and a Certified Trauma Recovery Coach. SHOW NOTES: Katherine Spearing MA, CTRC is the founder of Tears of Eden , a nonprofit supporting survivors of spiritual abuse, and the host of Tears\u0027 affiliate podcast Uncertain. She also hosts the podcast Trauma \u0026 Pop Culture and is a Certified Trauma Recovery Practitioner working primarily with clients who have survived cults, high-control environments, spiritual abuse, and sexual abuse. She also provides specialized trauma informed career coaching , as folks with trauma often need extra support for interviewing and networking. Katherine is the author of a historical romantic comedy, Hartfords , a novel that challenges gender roles in a patriarchal society that will appeal to fans of Jane Austen. She has been a guest on a number of podcasts, including IndoctriNation and That\u2019s So Fcked Up, is the author of several nonfiction articles, and writes regularly at katherinespearing.com and tearsofeden.org.

Anna Lebaron is one of more than fifty children born to infamous polygamist cult leader Ervil LeBaron, aka \u201CMormon Manson.\u201D So you can probably imagine that her upbringing was both extraordinary and devastating: As she recounts in her excellent book, The Polygamist\u2019s Daughter, she lost multiple family members at the hands of other family members, including those she lost in the infamous \u201C 4 o\u2019clock murders \u201D \u2014 a bit of blood atonement that led to four people being killed. Those murders are depicted in the 2024 Hulu documentary \u201CDaughters of the Cult.\u201D This week, we hear from Anna and her sister, Celia, about their stories \u2014 and their capacity to believe in rehabilitation and redemption. You might think that Anna would hold a lot of resentment against her father. (We sure would!) But that\u2019s not the case. Anna and Celia speak with compassion about their father \u2014 and of her brothers and half-brothers who committed murders at their father\u2019s bidding.

      "description": "This episode is sponsored by Better Help. Is the famed hedge fund Bridgewater Associates operating a cult in plain sight? Or is it just a little bit culty? Journalist and author Rob Copeland joins us for a deep dive into Wall Street\u2019s seedy underbelly, and the troubling story of Bridgewater\u2019s founder\u2014the pseudo philosopher-king Ray Dalio. You\u2019ll want to read Rob\u2019s NYT bestseller \u2018 The Fund \u2019 this summer, if you haven\u2019t already, and then you can decide whether or not you agree with us that Ray Dalio is radiating serious Keith Raniere vibes. Rob joins us to chat about Dalio\u2019s strange world and the uncanny parallels between the planet\u2019s largest hedge fund and NXIVM. About Rob Copeland: Rob Copeland is a finance reporter for the New York Times. He was previously the longtime hedge-fund beat reporter at the Wall Street Journal, and has also covered Silicon Valley and the hidden worlds of the wealthy and powerful. His front-page investigations into Bridgewater Associates won a New York Press Club award; he was also awarded an honorable mention twice by the Society of American Business Writers (SABEW) and was named a News Media Alliance \u0022Rising Star\u0022 (formerly Top 30 Under 30). He has appeared on ABC\u2019s \u0022Good Morning America,\u0022 NPR and other major news networks. His NYT Bestseller The Fund was published in late 2023, and we get why it topped the charts: We think it is a freakin\u2019 page turner! Show Notes: Assorted articles about The Fund, and Ray Dalio.

In this episode of A Little Bit Culty, licensed therapist and social media sweetheart Eli Harwood joins us for a chat about the way that attachment patterns impact our vulnerability to culty situations and vice-versa. It can be a real intricate venn diagram, ya know? (Or maybe it\u2019s a line graph, or a Gantt chart. We don\u2019t know. We\u2019re not chart people.) But however you map it, this stuff is always way better when you navigate it with a pro. The brilliant Ms. Harwood explains the brainy stuff of attachment theory along with D-I-Y tricks for better relationships, and helps us process our stuff in a way that made us laugh, cry, and also cry-laugh.

She\u2019s also a seeker and a licensed therapist who isn\u2019t afraid to let her professional opinions fly: Like what she always thought was slimy about Keith Raniere\u2019s shtick, and why she still has nothing but empathy for Nancy Salzman. There will be tears and laughs in this one. Enjoy: And don\u2019t forget to call your Mama.

      "description": "This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp. For Andrew LeCompte, his study of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) started off like the proverbial \u2018good thing\u2019 of so many cult survivor stories. He eventually taught ACIM in Mexico, Spain, Hawaii, and Canada\u2013working as something like a NXIVM-era Mark Vicente for his teacher. He initially had amazing experiences and believed he was on track to finding the \u2018Love of God.\u2019 But after six years of mistreatment, emotional manipulation, and being coerced out of over $200,000, the biggest miracle is that he got out and recovered his life. His memoir, Finding Miracles: Escape from a Cult, is a cautionary tale for seekers everywhere. We\u2019re talking to Andrew today about his experience, what drew him to ACIM, where it all went cattywampus, and how he only found the love he\u2019d been looking for after he escaped. SHOW NOTES: About Andrew LeCompte: With a master\u2019s degree in Humanistic Psychology in Organizations, Andrew developed a deeper method of interpersonal communication, which involves tapping into each person\u2019s emotions and what they are most hoping for. He then taught empathic speaking and listening skills to people in schools, colleges, civic groups, legal practices, hospitals, pharmaceutical and financial corporations. As President of the Let\u2019s Talk training group he led leadership programs, and additionally practiced management and organizational development. Andrew wrote a book summarizing this way of communicating: Creating Harmonious Relationships: a Practical Guide to the Power of True Empathy (2000). The book sold out and was translated into Turkish. A new revised edition has just been published! In the spiritual realm, Andy began meditating in the 1970s. In the 1990 he began studying the spiritual text, A Course in Miracles (ACIM). In 2004 he met the man who would become his ACIM guru/teacher. Andy discussed key points of ACIM with his wife, a clinical psychologist, who was not in agreement with a spiritually focused life. In 2011, Andy left his wife, son, friends, and all his possessions behind and moved 2,000 miles into his guru\u2019s ACIM-based community. There he contributed his teaching and counseling skills, plus his book editing and video editing skills. He moved with the cult to Spain, Hawaii, Canada, and Mexico. But after six grueling years he realized it was a cult and escaped with the help of his loving son. Cult psychology is a pernicious force. With the help and love of his family, psychotherapists and psychiatrists, Andrew engaged in an intensive recovery programs, which was completely successful. After researching cults and cult psychology, he wrote Finding Miracles: Escape from a Cult.

She shares what it was like flying in Werner Erhard\u2019s inner circle working as something of an Olivia Pope for the company\u2019s high falutin\u2019 events, and the moment that her dream gig turned into Red Flag City. Other highlights\u2013or lowlights more like it\u2013include: Erhard\u2019s legend materializing into (volatile) human form, and the scandal-plagued guru going Full Metal jacket. In this episode we also cover what it was like for her to confront the big lie behind the transformative work she believed in, and how she\u2019s picking up the pieces now after emerging from Landmark\u2019s dark side. Full disclosure: Sarah also rants a bit, and there are some cathartic tears. Landmark loyalists should know that Anne also expresses optimism for the company\u2019s future, should it decide to face its demons. (FWIW: We agree with her\u2026You could be a contender, Landmark. Maybe try using the criticism to grow, and think about taking some of your own tech as medicine. You got this. We believe in you!) SHOW NOTES: Anne Peterson spent 15\u0026#43; years selling, producing and facilitating transformative programs for an international personal and professional growth and development company. Since leaving, she has launched ILumn8.life , a learning hub and marketplace dedicated to the safe and ethical practice of providing personal development. Her memoir is available now on Amazon.

      "description": "This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp. Landmark has been the most requested topic from our listeners since day one of this podcast. When we got eyes on Anne Peterson\u2019s new memoir about her 15\u0026#43; year journey inside its ecosystem, we knew our listeners would be pissed at us if we didn\u2019t get her on our microphone, ASAP. \u2018\u2018Is This a Cult?: Confronting the Line Between Transformation and Exploitation\u2019 (available on Amazon) is a raw and gritty read, and tells the story of Anne\u2019s heartbreaking journey from starry-eyed idealist to disillusioned leader in a way that gives us NXIVM d\u00E9j\u00E0 vu all over again. There are also some incendiary stories of the famous large-group awareness training (LGAT) company\u2019s lurking ghost/guru/shapeshifter, the infamous Werner Erhard. In this first of two episodes with Anne, she shares what drew her to the organization and her whirlwind ascent through its ranks. And don\u2019t worry, Landmark top brass, if you\u2019re listening. We aren\u2019t throwing the wonderful, transformational baby out with the dirty bathwater. Nor is Anne. Just the opposite, in fact. We think you could realize your full potential if you actually listened and learned from the bad feedback, instead of shutting it down. So maybe this time, you\u2019ll make some meaning out of this before you start cranking out your latest cease and desist? Deep breaths. Good talk.

      "description": "This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp. Give online therapy a try at betterhelp.com/culty and get on your way to being your best self. Erika Cheung arrived at the Theranos corporate headquarters at just 22 years old as a newly minted college grad. At the time, the idealistic chemist and biologist saw Elizabeth Holmes just as so many others did: As a visionary on the verge of completely disrupting the healthcare paradigm. As it would turn out, Erika\u2019s honeymoon phase at her dream gig lasted all of seven months. That\u2019s when she quit her job in the Theranos lab, bought a burner phone, and blew the whistle on one of the biggest con artists in American business history. The Theranos story has always seemed more than a little bit culty to us, so we jumped at the chance to chat with Erika about her experience. After all, sometimes a culty situation starts out looking like a promising job offer with a \u2018visionary\u2019 who turns out to be a faux humanitarian. (We\u2019ve been there, Erika. Oh\u2026have we been there.) About Erika Cheung: Erika was born in Los Angeles, CA. She spent most of her education homeschooled, but started community college at age 14 and then went on to obtain a dual degree in Linguistics and Molecular and Cell Biology from UC Berkeley. She was one of the key whistleblowers that reported Theranos to health regulators. Her report subsequently led to the shut down of Theranos\u0027 clinical lab which prevented the company from providing false medical results to thousands of patients. This account is covered in the book Bad Blood by John Carreryrou, 60 Minutes, the ABC Podcast: The Drop Out , and Alex Gibney\u0027s documentary The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley . Erika is the executive director of Ethics in Entrepreneurship, a non-profit whose mission is to foster ethical questioning, culture, and systems in startups and startup ecosystems. She\u0027s currently working towards obtaining her ACFE-certified fraud examiner\u0027s license to educate others on fraud prevention strategies and develop programs to protect business stakeholders from high-risk ventures. She is also an advisor to several whistleblower advocacy organizations to support individuals who may She is also an avid mixed martial artist in her free time and hopes to support efforts that leverage martial arts to empower trauma survivors.

And\u2026we\u2019re back for part two of our conversation with Claire Headley, a defiant Scientology whistleblower who still owes the shadowy organization a billion minus 30 years on her contract. (Don\u2019t hold your breath, David Miscavige.) Born and bred in England\u2019s Scientology boarding schools before rising up through the ranks all the way to headquarters, Claire\u2019s escape after a lifetime of indoctrination is nothing short of heroic. In this follow-up, she shares more about the details of her exit, her thoughts on the future of Scientology, and her role as an expert witness for the prosecution in the Danny Masterson trial. This episode is as insidery as an insider account of L. Ron\u2019s house gets. Also, paging Trey Parker and Matt Stone: We see you and we appreciate you. SHOW NOTES: Claire Headley escaped L. Ron\u2019s Church of Scientology, bravely emerging from its dark depths to share her harrowing experiences with the world. Since breaking free 18 years ago, Claire has become a prominent advocate for survivors, shedding light on the church\u0027s practices, its culture of control, and the struggles faced by those who leave. She\u2019s also continued to be abused by its powerful reach. As President of The Aftermath Foundation, Claire helps others \u2013 often with no work experience or family beyond Sea Org \u2013 leave Scientology.

Headley was born and bred in England\u2019s Scientology boarding schools, was shipped to the big blue buildings in LA, and then onto headquarters.

She recounts personal tragedies and abuses. She tells us what it\u2019s like to experience the practice of fair game \u2013 beginning at age two. And she shares what the nearly intractable clutches of this 100% high-control group felt like. Until her own husband escaped without her, and the proverbial shelf broke. Her almost foiled escape is an action sequence you won\u2019t want to miss. SHOW NOTES: Claire Headley escaped L. Ron\u2019s Church of Scientology, bravely emerging from its dark depths to share her harrowing experiences with the world. Since breaking free 18 years ago, Claire has become a prominent advocate for survivors, shedding light on the church\u0027s practices, its culture of control, and the struggles faced by those who leave. She\u2019s also continued to be abused by its powerful reach. As President of The Aftermath Foundation, Claire helps others \u2013 often with no work experience or family beyond Sea Org \u2013 leave Scientology.

      "description": "Today\u2019s episode is sponsored by BetterHelp. If you\u2019re not already familiar with the culty cluster known as \u2018School\u2019, it was an ultra-secret Manhattan organization run by late actress and forever eccentric Sharon Gans. The shadowy group did its dark magic in the form of secret study groups, arranged marriages, and some pretty gnarly narcissistic abuse. In this episode, former School enrollee Esther Friedman discusses the five years she spent as a student after her study group love bombed her right into its clutches. We also cover how she got out, and how she\u2019s healing now by helping other gentle souls navigate a culty, culty world. Empaths, this one\u2019s for you. And if you\u2019ve got Big Valedictorian Energy and are crazy about that extra credit, please note that we\u2019ve taken our listeners to School before in our episode with the groovy Spencer Schneider who wrote a page-turning memoir about his experience titled Manhattan Cult Story: My Unbelievable True Story of Sex, Crimes, Chaos, and Survival . NOTES Esther Friedman is a licensed mental health counselor, expressive art therapist, songwriter, and author. To process and heal, she presents her misadventures as an \u201Cedu-tainment campaign.\u201D Her memoir The Gentle Souls Revolution is a PSA/recovery guide/template for anyone who\u2019s navigated exploitative relationships. She\u2019s also a board member of the newly formed nonprofit \u201CLiving Cult Free\u201D and is joined in that endeavor by some cult recovery heavyweights.

      "description": "This episode is sponsored by Better Help.  But maybe it should also be sponsored by a company that manufactures blood pressure cuffs, because the \u201CLet Us Prey: A Ministry of Scandals\u201D docuseries had us all kinds of pissed off. If you haven\u2019t seen it yet, the doc wades into the darkness and depravity within the Independent Fundamental Baptist (IFB) movement and takes no prisoners. Sidenote: Fuck you, IFB predators and enablers, fuck you very, very much.\u00A0 In this episode we speak with Ruthy Heiler, the whistleblower at the heart of the series, along with Sharon Liese, the series\u2019 Emmy-award winning director. Word to the wise; this conversation touches on sexual assault and abuse, so please listen with care. It\u2019s really appalling what some people do in the name of old time religion when it\u2019s actually just a front for being predatory scum.\u00A0  SHOW NOTES: Learn more about The Blind Eye Movement on Instagram and Facebook  Notes provided courtesy of Investigation Discovery:   Let Us Prey: A Ministry of Scandals, is a new four-part docuseries exposing the predatory and insidious behavior within the Independent Fundamental Baptist (IFB) Churches, and the struggles of survivors to find justice. Featuring first-hand accounts from survivors, church defectors and activists, it offers crucial insight into the troubling culture within the IFB and the stronghold the church has on its members. \u00A0 \u00A0 Since its inception in the 1950s, the IFB has evolved into one of the dominant religious forces in the United States today with an estimated 8 million believers spread out over 6,000 churches across the country. Let Us Prey uncovers the dark inner workings behind the IFB\u2019s cheery and virtuous exterior by exposing depraved secrets and violence that have existed within their churches for decades. Rituals oriented towards \u201Cbreaking a child\u2019s will,\u201D mind control and torture are only the tip of the iceberg. Below the surface lurks accusations of rape and physical abuse of members, including minors, at the hands of IFB figure heads.\u00A0 \u00A0 Anchored by the testimony of survivors who have come forward to tell their stories and seek justice, Let Us Prey explores the deep pain and lifelong trauma they experienced. Survivors and IFB defectors Ruthy Heiler, Kathy Durbin and Amanda Householder, among others, share their accounts of abuse at the hands of church leaders and the violence, manipulation and suspected cover-ups of other members. Also featuring key independent voices, including Fort Worth Star-Telegram reporter Sarah Smith \u2013 one of the first journalists to uncover IFB\u2019s tangled web of abuse allegations and unregulated teen boarding schools \u2013 Let Us Prey offers a deeper understanding of how those within the IFB have continued to operate unchecked for years. Through powerful, emotional testimonies and archival footage,\u00A0\u00A0  Let Us Prey: A Ministry Of Scandals Is produced for ID by ITV America\u2019s Good Caper Content, with Emmy Award-winning Director Sharon Liese, who created the series, serves as the director.

In fact, it\u2019s so epic that (picture this) we are holding an invisible boombox over our heads outside your window while blaring Peter Gabriel, asking you to listen. Got the picture? Okay cool: Because we\u2019re chatting with Ione Skye and Ben Lee, married podcasters that you may know from their hilarious  Weirder Together podcast. Or maybe you know him as a prolific singer-songwriter, and her from the high school of your John Hughes teen cinema dreams. Or maybe, just maybe, you were in a cult with them at some point. It\u2019s not statistically improbable because they\u2019ve been in a few culty situations, from chasing Qigong, to following Gurus and slinging DoTerra essential oils. Heads up: This isn\u2019t our regular format. It\u2019s more of a Rom-Com than the stuff of True Crime, but these two are thoughtful and funny as hell on the subject of loving people through\u2014and out of\u2014cults. And we\u2019re always interested in hearing from people who\u2019ve dabbled and ducked out before things got too fucky. Lots of cultiverse easter eggs in this one, from David Lynch to QAnon, Theranos to Sean Penn, Rick Ruben to Ruby Tuesday\u2019s\u2013just kidding about that last one. If you\u2019re a cult nerd, this one will be mother\u2019s milk.

In this episode, Nikieta discusses how they converted her. She describes the grooming and gaslighting. And she reveals which scriptures they use to keep people in line. Lucky for us and for her, Nikieta got out and is sharing how she reclaimed her life and helps others do the same. Also, she takes as many naps as she damn well pleases. We can totally roll with that. \u00A0 NOTES Nikieta Lambert spent 15 years in the International Churches of Christ and eventually rose to leadership. Then, when the Pandemic stopped everything, she stopped too. She witnessed the global movement for black and brown lives juxtaposed with a silent ICOC. And it all unraveled.

      "description": "Today\u2019s episode is sponsored by BetterHelp.\u00A0 We made you a mixtape of some of our fave segments from our full episodes with Daniel Shaw, LCSW,\u00A0 Dr. Ramani, and Dr. Natalie Feinblatt. Think of this as our Chicken Soup for the Culty Soul power-medley. We\u2019ve got Dan Shaw dropping knowledge on why traumatizing narcissists are so\u2026traumatizing. We\u2019ve got Dr. Ramani on how to recover from narcissistic abuse. And we\u2019ve got Dr. Natalie Feinblatt on Trauma, Addiction \u0026 Cult-Informed Therapy. It\u2019s practically a super group!\u00A0 Pull up a box of tissues, and get ready for all the feels. If you\u2019ve heard these chats before when they were first born as full ALBC episodes, we still think you\u2019ll get some good nuggets out of them. And yes, we love the word \u2018nugget\u2019 in any form in a way that may border on problematic. We\u2019ll be sure to talk to our therapist about that.\u00A0 \u00A0 NOTES: Daniel Shaw, LCSW \u00A0is a psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City and in Nyack, New York. He originally trained as an actor at Northwestern University and with the renowned teacher Uta Hagen in New York City, and later worked as a missionary for an Indian guru. His eventual recognition of cultic aspects of this organization led him to become an outspoken activist in support of individuals and families traumatically abused in cults. Simultaneous with leaving this group, Dan began his training in the mental health profession, becoming a faculty member and supervisor at the National Institute for the Psychotherapist in New York. His book, Traumatic Narcissism: Relational Systems of Subjugation, was published by Routledge in 2014 and was nominated for the distinguished Gradiva Award. In 2018, the International Cultic Studies Association awarded him the Margaret Thaler Singer Award for advancing the understanding of coercive persuasion and undue influence. Shaw\u2019s book Traumatic Narcissism and Recovery: Leaving the Prison of Shame and Fear will be published by Routledge in 2021. Dan joined Sarah and Nippy to share his story, drop some knowledge about the shameless ways of traumatizing narcissists, and provide insights on the recovery process.  Dr. Ramani Durvasula is the author of two books on the subject: Should I Stay or Should I Go: Surviving A Relationship with a Narcissist and Don\u2019t You Know Who I Am?: How to Stay Sane in an Era of Narcissism, Entitlement, and Incivility. Her work has been featured at SXSW, TEDx, the Red Table Talk, the Today Show, and Investigation Discovery. You can also find her on her wildly popular YouTube channel where she dispenses wisdom on protecting yourself from hoovering, gaslighting and other narc trademarks. Or put her  Navigating Narcissism podcast in your ears, on repeat: It\u2019s good stuff.  Dr. Natalie Feinblatt is a licensed clinical psychologist in private practice in Los Angeles, California who specializes in the treatment of addiction and trauma. And one of her trauma sub-specialties is working with former cult members. She received her BA from UCSD and her Masters \u0026 Doctorate from Pepperdine University, where she wrote her doctoral dissertation on psychotherapy with former cult members and has specialized in helping them ever since. She also does EMDR, Brainspotting, and other trauma-specific therapies. She was also featured on the series finale of \u2018Leah Remini: Scientology \u0026 The Aftermath.\u2019 Follow her on Instagram for tips, tools, and healing resources.\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0 Also\u2026Let it be known far and wide, loud and clear that\u2026 \u00A0 The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

      "description": "Today\u2019s episode is sponsored by BetterHelp.\u00A0 Just in case you\u2019re thinking about joining that incredible business opportunity selling a life changing product\u2026don\u2019t give them your credit card info until you\u2019ve listened to this A Little Bit Culty remix. We\u2019ve put together a special Anti-MLM 101 Starter Kit episode with some of our favorite crusaders in the war on schemes, scams, and other internet flim-flams especially for you. Our upline on this one is pretty solid.  We dug into our archives and Roberta Blevins came out swinging, so a segment from our  Season 2 episode with the LuLa Rich fan fave is at the top of the batting list. She chats with us about the dangers of moldy leggings, #bossbabe energy, pricey sea cruises, other MLM tomfoolery.  After Roberta, we move on to a clip from our more recent  episode with Emily Lynn Paulson, an author and mother who believes that all MLMs\u2014which form a $180 billion industry\u2014are cults. Spoiler alert: We violently agree.  And last but not least, we go all the way back to our  Season 1 chat with Douglas Brooks, an attorney and MLM-buster with insights on what it takes to seek justice for people who\u2019ve been screwed over. Take heart: When prosperity gospel grifters write big checks that their sneaky asses can\u2019t cash, there can be legal consequences.  NOTES: Roberta Blevins was a Trainer with LuLaRoe, had a team of 75 women under her, and made over $65,000 in bonuses alone. But when she came to the conclusion that it was a rigged, losing game she didn\u2019t just leave the business: she testified in the Washington State vs. LuLaRoe Pyramid Scheme lawsuit as a witness for the state. Since leaving MLM, the fan favorite from the  LuLaRich series has educated herself on the systemic structure of the business model, the psychological manipulation, the seedy underbelly and governmental ties, the cult indoctrination, and the history of Multi Level Marketing. She educates daily on TikTok, and podcasts in her \u0022free time\u0022 on her own podcast,  Life After MLM, which explores the dangers of Multi Level Marketing through the eyes of the victims and survivors. Her work has been featured on Amazon Prime Video, Vice Media, Bloomberg News, Split, and Business Insider among others. Learn more on her website or find her on Instagram @therealrobertablevins Emily Lynn Paulson is the author of Highlight Real: Finding Honesty and Recovery Beyond the Filtered Life, and Hey, Hun: Sales, Sisterhood, Supremacy, and the Other Lies Behind Multilevel Marketing. She has given two powerful TEDx talks, both challenging the status quo of parenting, alcohol use, and feminism as we know it. Paulson has also been featured in major publications such as the Today Show, New York Times, Washington Post, The Seattle Times, Chicago Tribune, Next Question with Katie Couric, and the Tamron Hall Show. She resides in Central Oregon with her husband and their five children. \u00A0 Also\u2026Let it be known far and wide, loud and clear that\u2026 The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

She got out, and today she\u2019s a self-described recovering wellness influencer on her way to becoming a Registered Psychotherapist. She\u2019s also working on her cult memoir, titled The MLM Recovery Handbook. She\u2019s on a mission to warn people, new moms especially, about the dark side of the wellness space. We\u2019ll also chat with her about her take on influencers, recruitment, and wellness coaches - and what happens when those things come wrapped in a glossy celebrity seal of approval. And hey, we love a wellness supplement, and even have some show sponsors from that space that we trust and can really stand by. But we also have no problem with calling bullshit on the culty side of the wellness world, and the MLM we\u2019re going to discuss in this episode has been on our radar for a while. Let\u2019s do this.\u00A0 \u00A0 NOTES: Brandie Hadfield is a mother, writer, speaker, and advocate speaking out about commercial cults, wellness scams, and legalized labor trafficking. She believes everyone deserves freedom of mind, so she speaks out about abuses of power and coercion perpetrated by MLM scams. Her memoir is forthcoming. In the meantime, you can read her writing on on Substack and find her profile on Instagram with especially relevant-to-us hashtags #commercialcult #MLMrecovery #igotout.\u00A0 \u00A0 Also\u2026 Let it be known far and wide, loud and clear that\u2026 \u00A0 The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

And she\u2019s the psychological sleuth who\u2019s highlighted one particularly culty behavior: gaslighting. Fun fact: Dr. Stern actually coined the phrase \u201Cthe gaslight effect.\u201D\u00A0\u00A0 As we know, gaslighting is straight out of the culty charismatic coercive fuckwad playbook. But we want to get specific and don\u2019t mean to merely call names. So in this episode, we go full CSI on gaslighting with Dr. Stern.

      "description": "Today\u2019s episode is sponsored by BetterHelp. If you had a good Waldorf experience, we\u2019re thrilled for you. Not all the schools are the same. Just like not all churches are the same. Don\u2019t get your knickers in a knot. But if there are things about Waldorf that chap your ass, pour yourself some tea because we have just the guest for you. In this episode Chloe Weise sheds light on her decade and a half in a Waldorf School before leaving for college and grad school. Now steeped in the scientific method and working in the tech industry, Chloe raises questions about Waldorf\u2019s founder, Rudolf Steiner, and teachings openly called \u201COccult Science.\u201D\u00A0 Was Rudolf Steiner an early 20th Century German mystic, or an arrogant semi-Christian evangelist for things like astral bodies, clairvoyance, and overtly racist pseudoscience. We\u0027re here to find out what Chloe thinks. This is Chloe\u2019s first time speaking publicly about her misgivings with Waldorf. We\u2019re honored she trusted us with her experience. Without further adieu, here\u2019s our chat with Chloe Weise. \u00A0 NOTES: Chloe Weise holds an MS in Evolutionary Biology and is a data analyst at Lumen Energy. Her research on paper wasps and logical reasoning was published in Proceedings B, the Royal Society\u2019s flagship biological research journal.

Jaime Mahler, MS, LMHC, is a New York-based psychotherapist and mental health educator who recently published her book TOXIC RELATIONSHIP RECOVERY: Your Guide to Identifying Toxic Partners, Leaving Unhealthy Dynamics, and Healing Emotional Wounds After A Breakup. She\u2019s also the powerhouse behind the explosively popular social media brand, Recollected. Her podcast, \u2018Unlearned,\u2019 helps people of all sexual orientations and genders to heal from relationship trauma, narcissism, and beyond\u2026certainly a lot of the BS we find ourselves tackling on this podcast.\u00A0 But today, in episode one of this two-parter, we\u2019re focusing somewhat on Mahler\u2019s past, which involved growing up with a self-described \u201Ccult-like version of Catholicism.\u201D She revists the types of shame and guilt she experienced within religious surroundings, despite their being a shade less extreme than others we\u2019ve encountered on this show. Even Jaime\u2019s OCD played a role in her religious fervor by tricking her brain into believing one is either purely good or purely evil\u2014wholy faithful or 100% a sinner\u2014eventually leading to semi-neurotic level praying on a daily basis.\u00A0 Ultimately, Jaime\u0027s odyssey of self-discovery and faith, coupled with her distinguished therapeutic training, makes her our favorite type of guest: a badass individual who has directly encountered some culty shit, complemented by a sophisticated educational background that not only helped her understand her own experiences, but those of others, too.\u00A0 \u00A0 Find Recollected Self on social media: Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, or visit their website \u00A0 Purchase Toxic Relationship Recovery: Your Guide to Identifying Toxic Partners, Leaving Unhealthy Dynamics, and Healing Emotional Wounds after a Breakup on  Amazon \u00A0 Also\u2026 \u00A0 Let it be known far and wide, loud and clear that\u2026 \u00A0 The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

But it wasn\u2019t merely homeschoolers that were a little bit culty in her life. With experiences of missionary evangelical Christianity, the New Thought movement, Scientology, and four years as an \u00A0e s t\u00A0 devotee, Julie Bogart\u2019s got some culty notches in her belt. Now she\u2019s helping cult-proof parents and their kids by teaching families to think well. In this episode, Julie shares insight into susceptibilities for cult-jumping, our perceptions of \u201Ctrusted\u201D authority/expertise, and the power of wonder and curiosity. We\u2019re also reminded of the parental golden rule: seek therapy yourselves before subjecting your kiddos to any kind of psychotherapy. For a deep dive into those waters, rewind to our episode with Meg Appelgate who navigated the Troubled Teen Industry firsthand. \u00A0 NOTES: Julie Bogart has devoted her life to the triumvirate of writing, kids, and parents and is known for her common sense parenting and education advice on how to raise critical thinkers. She created Brave Writer, an online writing and language arts program that coaches folks to discover their own original thoughts.

In this episode, Yasmine Mohammed invites us into her childhood to get a taste of what it was like to live in two different worlds \u2013 the West and fundamentalist Islam \u2013 while fitting into neither. She pulls back the curtain on the culty dynamics, indoctrination, and dehumanization characteristic of both worlds. We learn a little about her forced marriage to a member of Al-Qaeda at the age of 19. And she illuminates a Bill Maher moment with Ben Affleck that she believes exemplifies the West\u2019s deeply problematic approach to radical Islam.\u00A0\u00A0 Check it out. \u00A0 NOTES: Yasmine Mohammed is founder and President of Free Hearts Free Minds \u2013 an organization devoted to those free thinkers in Muslim-majority countries whose lives are at risk for who they love or the words they utter. She\u2019s a courageous and eloquent writer, podcaster, and human rights advocate as unafraid to criticize conversation police as she is to speak up against radical Islam. Yasmine is the author of Unveiled: How Western Liberals Empower Radical Islam, a memoir/polemic that explores her own history and how Western liberalism gets in the way of actualizing liberation. She\u2019s host of the podcast Forgotten Feminists that features inspirational women from restrictive religious backgrounds.

      "description": "Today\u2019s episode is sponsored by BetterHelp.\u00A0 The self-help book industry alone is expected to grow from $10.5 billion annually to $15 billion by 2025. Of course, with that kinda dough floating around, a raging demand for personal growth has led to a plethora of tools aimed at achieving it. Unfortunately, there are people that seek to take advantage of this, leading to dangerous\u2014or even deadly\u2014consequences.\u00A0 When Kirby Brown was only 38 years old, a man named James Arthur Ray pushed her to stick out an incredibly hot sweat lodge session in Sedona, Arizona. A self-proclaimed \u201Cguru,\u201D Ray allegedly urged participants to disregard their physical discomfort, even ignoring their pleas for help. Tragically, Brown and two other individuals lost their lives during the hellish experience.\u00A0 On today\u2019s episode, we\u2019re joined by two guests: Jean Brown, who is Kirby\u2019s sister and the co-author of\u00A0The Sweet Life Lived, a memoir she wrote with her mother about what happened to Kirby and its larger implications for the self-help industry. Joining her is Dr. Glenn Patrick Doyle, a psychologist who has teamed up with Jean to create the SEEK SAFELY non-profit org and podcast, both aimed at passing legislation within the self-help industry to prevent abuse in the future. \u00A0 You can follow Dr. Doyle on Instagram, Facebook, and X. \u00A0 You can follow Jean Brown on Instagram and X. \u00A0 You can follow SEEK SAFELY on Instagram, Facebook, and X.\u00A0 \u00A0 NOTES:  Dr. Glenn Patrick Doyle is a licensed psychologist who works with people struggling with complex trauma and dissociative disorders, including survivors of coercive control, cult abuse, medical trauma, clergy abuse, religious trauma, and childhood abuse and neglect.\u00A0 Jean is a writer and work-from-home-mom to two young children. She has Bachelor\u0027s degrees in political science and writing from Loyola University Maryland, and a Master\u2019s in Public Policy and Public Administration from Concordia University in Montreal. She is active in creating content for SEEK Safely Inc.\u2019s website, social media, brand outreach, and legislative effort. Jean lived in Thailand and has traveled extensively, including treasured memories of traveling with her sister Kirby.

      "description": "Today\u2019s episode is sponsored by BetterHelp.\u00A0 \u00A0 Just before Netflix premiered its sensational docuseries \u201CBad Vegan,\u201D Sarma Melngailis spoke exclusively with ALBC about all the shit she endured with culty conman Mr. So-called Fox. Go back and check out that  episode for the grisly details and now foreboding hope that Netflix would shed light \u2013 not shade \u2013 on the confounding circumstances that led to the demise of Sarma\u2019s brand One Lucky Duck and her beloved restaurant Pure Food and Wine. If you didn\u2019t already know it, Pure Food and Wine was hip, sexy, nutritious, and delicious. It was raw vegan food with style in Gramercy Park. Manhattan where, on any given night, you could run into Janet Jackson, Bill Clinton, Stevie Wonder, or Alec Baldwin. It was the shit. Until it wasn\u2019t.\u00A0 \u00A0 Netflix was ready. \u00A0 Through all the pomp and circumstance, we at ALBC can\u2019t help but look into the dark side of cult survivor narratives turned entertainment. Now that the trauma-coaster of \u201CBad Vegan\u201D has slowed, we thought it important to let Sarma set the record straight.\u00A0 \u00A0 Check it out.   NOTES:Sarma Melngailis is brilliant. She grew up in Newton, MA, graduated with two economics degrees including one from the Wharton School. She rocked the financial world at Bear Stearns and Bain Capital. And she dabbled in high-yield investment funds before realizing finance in late-stage capitalism fuckin sucks so she left to get a degree in feeding people from the French Culinary Institute. Thus began her life in the world of food. Upon discovering raw vegan food, she decided \u2013 with a partner \u2013 to open Pure Food and Wine; chronicled her transition from eating whatever/everything to eating only raw vegan food in Raw Food Real World; and then wrote Living Raw Food. Now, she lives in Harlem with her rescue dog, Leon. We love \u2018em both dearly. You can find Sarma on Twitter, Instagram, and her own official website.

Also hard to watch. Also a bit infuriating. In other words: A culty docuseries. If you\u2019ve already followed the Duggars, the reality TV mega-family behind the hit show 19 Kids and Counting, you know it\u2019s all a lot to process. Shiny Happy People gets deep into the weeds of the story behind their story: Chock-full of disturbing insights into their scandals, their demons, and the radical organization underpinning the whole shitshow. That would be the  Institute in Basic Life Principles, an evangelical Christian ministry on steroids.\u00A0 Lindsey Williams is featured in Shiny Happy People, and is here to talk with us in this episode about her experience as a former IBLP member, and her personal journey from dug in to \u201Cfuck this I\u2019m out.\u201D Our chat covers IBLP founder Bill Gothard and his deranged dogma, what it was like living in the orbit of the embattled Duggar clan, and how Lindsey is doing now that she\u2019s a self-proclaimed Shiny Happy Warrior for cult awareness.\u00A0 And just as a heads up, please know that this IBLP organization has some seriously shady philosophies on things like sexual abuse, so this episode may get into gritty territory. Listen with care.\u00A0  Also\u2026 Let it be known far and wide, loud and clear that\u2026 \u00A0 The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

      "description": "This episode is sponsored by Better Help.\u00A0 Well hello there, A Little Bit Culty listener. How\u2019d your summer go? What\u2019s the haps? This is actually our out of office greeting talking to you, because we\u2019re away from the studio right now investigating some kickass episodes for our new season. But we didn\u2019t want to leave you hanging\u2026so we went through the archives to make you a veritable Dairy Queen Blizzard of culty goodness from some of our fan favorites. We\u2019ll be back soon with all new episodes, but until then you can also find us each week on Patreon where we\u2019re serving up fresh episodes and content on the regular.  So today\u2019s episode is\u2026well\u2026in our wheelhouse. If you\u2019re a listener of this particular show, you\u2019re already familiar with NXIVM \u2013\u00A0but on today\u2019s episode we are taking a closer look at the cult featured in the HBO series, The Vow, starring yours truly. (Whose got four thumbs and once helped bring NXIVM down? THESE GUYS).  Joining us are 4 people who understand the inner workings of NXIVM\u00A0 better than almost anyone else. First up is Mark Vicente. He\u2019s The Vow\u2019s Stone cold silver fox, a film-maker turned whistleblower, and an internationally renowned sweetheart. He\u2019s the guy who originally recruited me, and the guy who raised hell to help bring it all down.\u00A0 Also, he\u2019s the lucky husband of the one and only Bonnie Piesse, aka, Bonfire.  Next is India Oxenberg, who went through hell and back in NXIVM\u2019s darkest chapter: DOS. From forced starvation, and sleep deprivation, to multiple forms of mental and sexual abuse, to a devastating years-long separation from her family. God damn we\u2019re glad she got out and that she\u2019s THRIVING now. .\u00A0 \u00A0 Ater India, we\u2019ve got Susan Dones\u2026.The one-woman wrecking crew who served as her own legal representation in a series of court battles after she left the organization. Susan was way ahead of the curve on calling bullshit Keith Raniere and his flying monkeys. She also paid dearly for it.\u00A0 \u00A0 And finally, is Karen Unterrainer, who at only 18-years-old,\u00A0 became romantically intertwined with Keith Raniere. Over the next 40 years, she\u2019d go on to become a top level NXIVM trainer, a key figure of the Executive Success Programs\u2019 leadership committee, and an overseer of administration (bookkeeping) and IT.\u00A0 Which is all to say: There is much tea to spill. So much tea.  So if you\u2019re sick of hearing us talk about NXIVM, you better turn around now. You\u2019ve been warned. Everybody else? Let\u2019s rock.

      "description": "This epiosde is sponsored by Better Help. Hey Listener, you asked for a greatest hits medley of all our NXIVM related guests in one or two meaty episodes.And hear ye, hear ye we have delivered. This is our second NXIVM extravaganza, and we hope you dig it. We\u2019ll be back soon with all new episodes, and until then you can always hang out with us on Patreon at patreon.com/alittlebitculty if you can\u2019t get enough of our culty, culty content.\u00A0  But now\u2026let\u2019s dig into the main course shall we? Keith Raniere\u2019s trial was at the center of The Vow Season 2 \u2013\u00A0and this episode is taking you even further into the courtroom circus. \u00A0 We\u2019re featuring insights from three people who had as close a look as one could get. \u00A0 First, you\u2019ll hear from Moira Kim Penza \u2013\u00A0the prosecutor who brought Keith Raniere to justice. Her accomplishments are mighty: Like Keith\u2019s conviction on all counts including racketeering and sex trafficking and a brisk 120 year sentence. Moira\u2019s groundbreaking approach to the case has been credited with paving the way for other sex trafficking prosecutions against powerful individuals. In other words: She\u2019s a total badass. In this episode, Moira sits down with Sarah and Nippy to talk about what it\u2019s like to take on a world-class dirtbag (our wording, not hers) and what really chaps her ass about NXIVM\u2019s Voldemort.  More about today\u2019s guest: Moira is now in private practice as a litigator, and a partner at Wilkinson Stekloff. Crain\u2019s New York business named her in the 40 under 40 list, she\u2019s been ranked as one of Bloomberg Law\u2019s 40 under 40, and her legal analysis has been featured in The NY Times, CNN, ABC, NPR and Daily Beast.\u00A0 \u00A0 Next you\u2019ll hear from Robert Gavin.  Robert\u00A0 has been a news reporter for 28 years, having also worked for two years as an editor. Originally from Staten Island, Gavin began his career by covering the New York City police and fire departments, the NYS Capitol, State and Federal Courts, various murder trials, and cases involving terrorism, the mafia, street gangs, and political corruption. And eventually, Robert\u2019s role in the NXIVM trials and their coverage would play a crucial part in bringing down Keith Raniere. \u00A0 Finally, you\u2019ll hear from\u00A0 Vanessa Grigoriadis, who is an award-winning longform journalist and podcaster, having published profiles on the likes of Karl Lagerfeld, Lady Gaga, and Arianna Huffington. So how did she get tied up in NXIVM\u2019s bullshit while also reporting on the cult? Well, the short answer is: anyone and everyone is susceptible to coercive control and persuasion, even members of the press. The long answer? Well, you\u2019ll just have to listen to find out.\u00A0 \u00A0 Without further adieu. Here\u2019s our NXIVM medley part two.

Until then, you can always join us over on Patreon - that\u2019s patreon.com/alittlebitculty for new weekly episodes, adfree, and other treats.\u00A0 But right now? We\u2019re about to get in the weeds of one of our favorite topics with some of our fan favorites.\u00A0 On todays episode we are diving head first into the fucked up world of abstinence pledges, purity rings, and knee length skirts. That\u2019s right, we are going deep in the purity culture discussion and we aren\u2019t pulling out. \u00A0 Joining us are three powerhouse guests. \u00A0 First is the most rockin\u2019 reverend we\u2019ve ever met. \u00A0 Nadia Bolz-Weber is an ordained Lutheran Pastor, and founder of House for All Sinners \u0026 Saints in Denver:\u00A0 a progressive, queer-inclusive Lutheran congregation. She\u2019s written three New York Times bestselling memoirs, including Shameless: A Sexual Reformation, which takes on what she sees as the harmful ideas about sexuality that Christianity has promoted throughout history. She\u2019s the creator and host of The Confessional podcast, a pop-up prayer network called The Chapel, and a wildly inspirational Substack called The Corners.\u00A0 \u00A0 Next up is Alice Greczyn - an actress, author, and founder of Dare to Doubt. Her story includes a painful yet rewarding transition from Christianity to atheism, a journey that inspired her to found DaretoDoubt.org, a resource site for people detaching from belief systems they come to fnd harmful.\u00A0 \u00A0 And last, and probably least, Eric Skwarczynski is the host and creator of the Preacher Boys podcast, which is a platform for survivors\u2019 stories about a deeply disturbing pattern of sexual predation and abuse claims within the Independent Fundamental Baptist movement.\u00A0 \u00A0 You won\u2019t want to miss a single second of todays show, so let\u2019s get started with our personal Fuck You to Purity Culture, featuring Nadia Bolz Weber, Alice Greczyn, and Eric Skwarczynski.

      "description": "Today\u2019s episode is sponsored by BetterHelp. We\u2019re back with another greatest hits mashup this week, pulled together from the Little Bit Culty archives for your late listening pleasure because\u2026well\u2026we can\u2019t quit you - not even for a short late summer, early fall hiatus. Can you believe some shows go on hiatus? LAMMMMMME! Not us. Breaks are for babies.\u00A0  For real though, while we\u2019re working on fresh batches of cult-busting brand new episodes, we wanted to stir that proverbial pot a little more by revisiting one of our favorite culty topics\u2026.Scientology.  AKA, the brainchild of L. Ron.\u00A0 You know it, you loathe it, or\u2026maybe you just mock it. To be fair, unless you\u2019re a Scientologist, they think you\u2019re pretty silly too. So it\u2019s all even-stevens  We are diving deep into the Danger Zone in this episode \u2013\u00A0featuring 3 top guns who have taken on the Impossible Mission of exposing Scientology \u2013\u00A0which we all know can be Risky Business.  Ok, enough Tom Cruise puns \u2013\u00A0let\u2019s introduce A Few Good Men \u2013\u00A0and a super badass woman \u2013\u00A0who you\u2019ll hear from on today\u2019s show.  First up is the patron saint of cult-busting, Leah Remini, who\u2019s book Troublemaker chronicles her remarkable journey toward emotional and spiritual freedom from Scientology, both for herself and for her family.  Next is Mike RInder. Having spent his youth doing things like, for example, swabbing the decks of L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s yacht, Rinder eventually made it into the elite sect of Scientology known as the Sea Organization, eventually becoming Scientology\u2019s International Spokesperson and the head of its Office of Special Affairs. Then, he escaped and became a fearless and outspoken ex-member.  Last is Jon Atack \u2013 one of the only court-appointed expert witnesses on Scientology, and his book:  Let\u2019s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky, about the early history of the church, is cited by academics all over the world. Jon was a \u2018public\u2019 Scientologist for nine years, trained as a counselor, and even did the secret \u2018OT\u2019 levels, but ditched it when he discovered appalling, aggressive behavior towards members. In addition to his work podcasting as a  Scientology mythbuster\u00A0 and using his Instagram account to help educate people on overcoming things like manipulation, destructive cults, and abusive relationships, he\u2019s written several novels, including  Voodoo Child (Slight Return), inspired by the life and downfall of Jimi Hendrix. \u00A0 Without further ado\u2026please enjoy this Scientology Sucks, Sorry Not Sorry, A Little Bit Culty Medley.\u00A0 \u00A0 Also\u2026  Let it be known far and wide, loud and clear that\u2026  The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

Rebecca Bender grew up in a small town, played varsity sports, made high school honor roll, and would have started college early except she got pregnant. She was a little ostracized.

She followed her knight in shining armor to Las Vegas only to be sold among three human traffickers.\u00A0 She was branded, thrown in jail, and hospitalized, her face broken in five different places. But she wasn\u2019t kidnapped. And there was no duct tape involved.\u00A0 Now, Rebecca Bender is a mentor/survivor/expert flipping the script on who leads the fight to eradicate human trafficking. She\u2019s blazing trails with the largest online school in the world for survivors. And, as an internationally recognized subject matter expert, she\u2019s equipped the FBI, Homeland Security, and the US Department of Justice to spot this stuff before it gets any worse.

After high school, he signed a billion-year contract and was admitted into Scientology\u2019s elite inner circle, the Sea Organization. Brought to founder L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s yacht and promised training in Hubbard\u2019s most advanced techniques, Mike was instead put to work swabbing the decks.\n\nStill, Rinder bought into the doctrine that his personal comfort was secondary to the higher purpose of Hubbard\u2019s world-saving mission, swiftly rising through the ranks. In the 1980s, Rinder became Scientology\u2019s international spokesperson and the head of its powerful Office of Special Affairs. He helped negotiate Scientology\u2019s pivotal tax exemption from the IRS and engaged with the organization\u2019s prominent celebrity members, including Tom Cruise, Lisa Marie Presley, and John Travolta.\n\nYet Rinder couldn\u2019t shake a nagging feeling that something was amiss\u2014Hubbard\u2019s promises remained unfulfilled at his death, and his successor, David Miscavige, was a ruthless and vindictive man who did not hesitate to confine many top Scientologists, Mike among them, to a makeshift prison known as the Hole.\n\nIn 2007, at the age of fifty-two, Rinder finally escaped Scientology. Overnight, he became one of the organization\u2019s biggest public enemies. He was followed, hacked, spied on, and tracked. But he refused to be intimidated and today helps people break free of Scientology.\n\nIn his book, A Billion Years, the dark, dystopian truth about Scientology is revealed as never before. Rinder offers insights into the religion that only someone of his former high rank could provide and tells a harrowing but fulfilling story of personal resilience.\n\nAlso\u2026\n\nLet it be known far and wide, loud and clear that\u2026\n\nThe views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

The oldest of seven siblings, Hayley managed to escape her marriage and the Church to live her life as an out-and-proud lesbian while still maintaining a real (albeit heavily strained) relationship with some of her family. In doing so, she learned that perhaps her family\u2019s belief that life is about sacrifice and being miserable means you\u2019re doing something right is NOT the most fun way to live life!\u00A0 Now, it\u2019s safe to say Morgan is making all her decisions for herself as a prominent fitness and yoga instructor, and is much happier for it.\u00A0 \u00A0 Follow Morgan on Instagram Visit Morgan\u2019s website",

Having achieved nation-wide fame on America\u2019s Got Talent, the Willis Fishers scored their own reality show in 2015, letting cameras into their pristine and heavily Christian home to document the daily lives of a happy, smiley family trying to make it in the famously non-toxic (just kidding) entertainment biz.\u00A0 So when allegations of child abuse and molestation broke out against the family\u2019s patriarch, Toby Willis, Americans and onlookers across the globe were in disbelief. How could this family, which had been put on a pedestal and idolized extensively as \u201Cpicture perfect,\u201D possess such insanely disturbing secrets?\u00A0 Because the world is fucked up, hellooo! But our listeners already knew that.\u00A0 On today\u2019s episode, Jessica joins us to discuss her story, as well as parallels she sees between her family and others that shared the reality show spotlight. She\u2019s begun releasing new music again as a form of healing\u2014you can check out her album Brand New Day\u00A0here.

One of the cult\u2019s best known smaller mythologies was its ability to cure Tourette\u0027s Syndrome, which is a condition in the nervous system that causes tics like sudden and uncontrollable movements or vocal outbursts. It should be noted that while there are certainly various treatments for managing TS, there is still no known cure.\u00A0 This explains why today\u2019s guest, Isabella Constantino, was attracted to NXIVM and the extraordinary results they were boasting about with their TS study. Ultimately, Constantino wound up postponing her last semester of college and moving to Albany in order to engrain herself in the study and to pursue personal growth, both of which she did for a total of three years before finally escaping. Now, she\u2019s spent half a decade recovering her \u201Csense of self\u201D and navigating life post-NXIVM.\u00A0 But how did NXIVM actually approach this \u201Cscientific\u201D study, and what abusive methods did they apply from their typical conditioning in order to combat Tourette\u2019s? Lastly, did any of their techniques actually help with TS, and if so, at what cost?\u00A0 \u00A0 For more about Isabella Constanto, check out her site, Instagram, and Facebook:\u00A0 Website Instagram Facebook \u00A0 Please note, this series includes details of sexual abuse.

For example, we have the Duggar family and their show 19 and Counting, which broadcasted the daily lives of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar and their army of children between 2008 and 2015 to millions of viewers around the world. Now, a new documentary on the family called Shiny Happy People, according to TIME, \u201Cincludes testimonies from daughter Jill (Duggar) Dillard, her husband Derick Dillard, niece Amy (Duggar) King, as well as several former IBLP members, reveals that the family and larger religious group was dealing with allegations of sex abuse, child abuse and financial mistreatment.\u201D Our guest today, author Tia Levings, spoke in this documentary based on her experiences as a thought leader on abuse within Christian Fundamentalism, but also a survivor of such abuse herself. Having grown up in a Southern Baptist Megachurch, Levings gets into how she slowly but surely slipped into a high-control group (read: cult) wherein men are considered accountable for their wives before God, and therefore must lead and discipline them.\u00A0 Her memoir, A Well-Trained Wife, will be released in August of 2024.

This judgment will be an end to this harrowing yet enthralling story, which turned 49-year-old mom and Mormon, Lori Vallow into an international media fixture, seemingly entangled in a web of infanticide, zombies, escapes to Hawaii, and a trail of mysterious deaths that remain suspicious as hell.\u00A0  On today\u2019s episode, we\u2019re joined by freelance journalist and author Leah Sottile, whose book  When the Moon Turns to Blood: Lori Vallow, Chad Daybell, and a Story of Murder, Faith, and End Times, illuminates the story of the former beauty queen and her grave-digger turned doomsday novelist slash extremist douchebag husband, Chad.

If hell is real, there is perhaps no circle of it as harrowing nor vile as the experience of growing up in the Children of God cult. Still active under the name \u201CThe Family International,\u201D the group is known for being a real-life manifestation of the shittiest of shitty macabre practices, such as child sexual abuse involving their \u201CLaw of Love,\u201D\u2014a mandate for females of all ages to show Jesus their love by letting men straight up rape them.\u00A0  One would hope that growing up in COG would be the last coercive, abusive, and negligent experience for today\u2019s guest, Daniella Mestyanek Young, who is an American author, keynote speaker, and previous Captain in the US Army. One would also hope for ponies and rainbows and a bigger tax return this year but HEY, life\u2019s no cake walk. On today\u2019s episode, Young discusses her book Uncultured: a Memoir, wherein she details her cult-riddled childhood and how, shockingly, the US Army reflected comparable practices.\u00A0  But how?

While there is of course no shortage of fake news out there, the main goal of the press is to keep society honest, investigating everything from corrupt governments to those cute little cliques we like to call cults.\u00A0  Robert Gavin has been a news reporter for 28 years, having also worked for two years as an editor. Originally from Staten Island, Gavin began his career by covering the New York City police and fire departments, the NYS Capitol, State and Federal Courts, various murder trials, and cases involving terrorism, the mafia, street gangs, and political corruption. And eventually, Robert\u2019s role in the NXIVM trials and their coverage would play a crucial part in bringing down Keith Raniere, which we\u2019re sure you saw on HBO\u2019s \u201CThe Vow.\u201D On today\u2019s episode, we talk to Gavin about his time covering the cult, as well as the aftermath.\u00A0  Please note, this series includes details of sexual abuse.

      "description": "This episode is sponsored by Better Help. There\u2019s certainly no shortage of groups that are A Little Bit Culty. That said, there are some major differences between cults and organized religions, and it\u2019s worth remembering that not ALL religion is bad, per se.\u00A0  Our very own producer and editor, Will Retherford of Citizens of Sound, grew up in the Evangelical Church, specifically the Word of Faith movement, and even ventured off to countless missionary campaigns across the globe to spread the good word. He became a worship leader, was on his way to become a priest, and was committed to all things Jesus Christ until he realized that, perhaps, his entire life was built around something he wasn\u2019t sure he actually believed in.\u00A0  In today\u2019s episode, Will discusses his time in the church, navigating through toxic groups, leaders and doctrine, his deconstruction, and how he feels about religion today.\u00A0  Follow Will Retherford on Instagram and Citizens of Sound.

The self-proclaimed \u201CApostle of God\u201D was eventually denied bail after setting that bail at $50 million, which according to the California Attorney General, was the highest ever imposed on an individual by the Los Angeles County. The denial came about because prosecutors feared his extremely loyal followers might actually raise the cash.\u00A0  We spoke to Sochil Martin who was born into the LLDM and broke away from it after a lifetime of abuse. The outspoken survivor and whistleblower shares her experience\u2013from being raised in church\u2019s clutches and ultimately fleeing, to helping federal agents bring Garc\u00EDa to justice, and how she\u2019s healing now.

      "description": "It was the early \u201870s and life was weird. War was still going on in Vietnam, and those back in the US of A were struggling with political, societal, and economic changes. One day, Diane Benscoter passed a van where some strangers were giving out bananas. She grabbed a snack and avoided making conversation with the van people. Shortly after, she was on a five-day trek from Omaha to Des Moines with those banana enthusiasts, who were in fact Sun Myung Moon enthusiasts. Next thing you know, Diane\u2019s cut off all of her hair, done some fasting, and has dedicated five years to selling candy and flowers while devoted to the second coming of Christ.\u00A0  You can read all about this in her memoir, linked out below. But on today\u0027s episode, we\u2019re focusing on Diane\u2019s organization, Antidote, which helps people escape from cults, or to get their loved ones out of cults and extremist mentalities such as those shared by QAnon. Having experienced cult life herself, Diane knows that convincing someone that everything they hold true in their life is a vicious lie can be next to impossible. That\u2019s why she became a master at it.\u00A0  Check out Antidote.ngo Purchase  Shoes of a Servant: My Unconditional Devotion to a Lie",

If you like what you hear, just know there\u2019s plenty more of it available for an extremely agreeable price. If you\u2019re not interested, don\u2019t worry, we still love you! Just less.

Even though she\u2019s no longer a journalist, she loves to keep up to date with all things cultiverse\u2014just like you guys!  So what did we think about being featured less heavily in this season?

And so it\u2019s no real surprise that when people like Jamiyla Chisholm\u2019s father heard about a religious community that would, as Jamiyla put it, protect them from the hellish world and teach them how \u201Cthey should live as Black people,\u201D they were drawn like moths to a flame.\u00A0  While we\u2019ve seen time and time again that cults prey on the vulnerable, this often takes advantage of an individual\u2019s current mental, financial, or even physical state. In this particular case, one leader took advantage of nation-wide racial tensions in order to seduce hundreds of people into his community, which merged practices from Islam, Judaism, and various political ideologies.\u00A0  Who was this leader? Well, we don\u2019t want to give it all away\u2026but here\u2019s a hint: the supreme douchebag is serving 135 years in prison for what\u2019s been reported as the largest prosecution of child molestation ever directed at an individual in the history of the USA.\u00A0  To find out who we\u2019re talking about, tune in to hear author, journalist, storyteller and educator Jamiyla Chisholm discuss her own experience as a member of this cult, as detailed in her memoir, The Community.\u00A0  Jamiyla\u2019s Website Jamiyla\u2019s Instagram Jamiyla\u2019s Twitter Buy  The Community: A Memoir  Also\u2026  Hear Ye, Hear Ye:  The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

But one person they really hate is Mike Rinder. How could anyone hate someone who\u2019s last name sounds like reindeer, especially just a few weeks after Santa made his international rounds on that reindeer-driven slay? Well, having spent his youth doing things like, for example, swabbing the decks of L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s yacht, Rinder eventually made it into the elite sect of Scientology known as the Sea Organization, eventually becoming Scientology\u2019s International Spokesperson and the head of its Office of Special Affairs. Then, he escaped and became a fearless and outspoken ex-member. If you didn\u2019t listen to the first interview we did with Mike, we\u2019re officially mad at you! But we can forgive and forget\u2014just check it out  here.\u00A0  So why did we have him back on the show? Because he\u2019s so fucking lovely. Also, because he just released his new memoir: A Billion Years: My Escape From a Life in the Highest Ranks of Scientology. It\u2019s a batshit crazy and exclusive, first-hand look into the inner workings of Scientology and the harm this organization does to its brainwashed members. And in today\u0027s episode, we specifically get into how Scientology could potentially come to an end (hint: it involves the IRS no longer putting up with the \u201Cchurch\u2019s\u201D bullshit).\u00A0  So say a little prayer to Xenu and strap on in, cuz this one\u2019s a wild ride!\u00A0  Buy  A Billion Years: My Escape From a Life in the Highest Ranks of Scientology Mike\u2019s blog Mike\u2019s Website  Mike\u2019s Facebook Mike\u2019s Instagram  Also\u2026  Hear Ye, Hear Ye:  The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

      "description": "This episode was originally released on Zen Parenting Radio. Here\u2019s a scary thought: fully-grown adults are susceptible to cults, or cult-adjacent behavior (there is truly cultish influence all around us in politics, wellness communities, and so on). So imagine how dangerous this whole world is for children, who are far less likely to have the wherewithal to identify and refute coercive persuasion. If you\u2019re one of our regular listeners, you already know how ubiquitous this shit is (unfortunately); so what can we do to protect our youth?\u00A0  Well, that\u2019s exactly what we got into with our friends over at Zen Parenting Radio, where Cathy Cassani Adams (a self proclaimed \u201Cspiritual and emotional mom\u201D) and Todd Adams (\u201Ca logical and practical dad\u0027\u0027) get into all things parenting. On their show, we not only recount our own story with NXIVM (perhaps you\u2019ve heard about, read about, or seen it by now?), but also the importance of talking to kids about how relationships that might initially feel exciting or just \u201Cgood\u201D in some way\u2014friends, coaches, teachers, bosses, etc.\u2014can quickly pivot into something abusive. How can we teach kids to identify culty behavior and help them feel safe enough to ask for help?\u00A0  This one\u2019s for anyone who believes we need to keep our kids safe from evil, shitty shitheads.

Over the next 40 years, she\u2019d go on to become a top level NXIVM trainer, a key figure of the Executive Success Programs\u2019 leadership committee, and an overseer of administration (bookkeeping) and IT.  Now free of Raniere\u2019s coercive control (read: fuckery), Unterreiner has spent the last five years recovering and discovering her true self. For today\u2019s episode, we spoke with her about dating an actual monster, how NXIVM functioned as a company, (and why it was messy), and whether or not the technology they used was actually any good, or more like rubbing two sticks together.\u00A0  Also\u2026  Hear Ye, Hear Ye:  The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

Enter licensed marriage and family therapist Diane Dierks with Dr. Rick Voyles, the CEO of the Center of Dispute Solutions, and their fabulously insightful podcast \u201CCo-Parent Dilemmas,\u201D which aims to provide practical solutions to families struggling with co-parenting.\u00A0  We\u2019re lucky to have these two experienced smarties on the show with us to discuss a specific and controversial topic: what some refer to as \u201Cthe alienating parent,\u201D which relates heavily to one of our favorite topics on this show (although least favorite things in like, \u201Creal life\u201D), the cult of one. Now, the National Center for State Courts defines parental alienation as \u201Ca strategy whereby one parent intentionally displays to the child unjustified negativity aimed at the other parent.\u201D But why has the term brought up some of that good ol\u2019 conflict we mentioned amongst clinicians today, dividing those who use the term and those who refuse to?

So what does \u201Ccoercive control\u201D look like in real life, you ask? Well, it could involve isolating someone away from friends and family, depriving them of basic human needs (food, water, etc.), humiliating them, managing someone else\u2019s finances, and the like. If it\u2019s a shitty way of controlling another human, like having an invisible chain wrapped around their ankles, it\u2019s coercive control. If you want a pop culture reference, look no further than Britney Spears\u2019 \u201CToxic\u201D family usurping her finances and personal agency for her nearly 14-year conservatorship.\u00A0  But does it still feel abstract? Then you need to listen to today\u2019s episode, complete with special guest Dr. Christine Cocchiola, a coercive control advocate, researcher, educator, and survivor, (meaning she\u2019s able to speak on the subject from both personal and scholarly levels). During our talk, she breaks down how narcissism, shame, egos, and \u201Cperfect preys\u201D play out with everyone from romantic partners to people in power, such as cult leaders.\u00A0  Are you perhaps being controlled by someone without even realizing it?

Our guest on today\u2019s show, Elissa Wall, had to live through them.\u00A0  Born into a polygamous family within Salt Lake City, Utah\u2019s FLDS\u2014which is how we\u2019ll be referring to it from here on out\u2014 Wall was only 14 when church leaders orchestrated a marriage between the child and her 19-year-old cousin, Allen Steed. Unfortunately, such marriages were insanely frequent within the church, with girls as young as 12-years-old being groomed and forced to marry older men. Much of this is thanks to human trash can Warren Jeffs, president and prophet of the FLDS, who can also add convicted child rapist to his list of titles. At one point, Jeffs had 78 \u201Cwives,\u201D 24 of whom were children.

So there must be tons of material out there educating children on what abuse looks like, and what they should do if they are abused, right? Wrong\u2014such resources have been virtually non-existent thus far. Today\u2019s guest and actual angel on Earth (but not in a culty way), Dr. Amy Saltzman, is working on changing that with her Spot a Spider series, designed specifically for children and teenagers to help identify when abuse is actually taking place\u2014something that\u2019s far less obvious than one might think.\u00A0  Dr. Amy Saltzman is a former competitive gymnast, a physician, a mindfulness coach, author, and victim/sur-thrivor of decades of covert emotional abuse.

      "description": "This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp. Our guests today want you to know that culty shit is rampant in high performance gymnastics, and it didn\u2019t all magically go away with Larry Nassar\u2019s prison sentence. How are these abusive creeps still slipping through the system and continuing to get access to young athletes? How do you protect your kid from harm if they develop a passion for the sport? Kim Shore is the founder of Gymnasts for Change Canada, a collective that emerged on the heels of the #metoo movement in 2017 after several former elite athletes publicly shared their experiences of abuse. She\u2019s joined by fellow advocate and former Canadian national team gymnast Melanie Hunt, who is sharing her own grisly account of psychological, physical, and sexual abuse at the hands of her coaches during her fifteen-year career. The duo chats with us about their stories and their shared mission of eradicating abuse from the sport that they love. Because the scariest thing about gymnastics should be the balance beam. This episode is a must-hear for parents who are raising student athletes in any sport, but be warned: It\u2019s not easy listening. Audience discretion advised.\u00A0  Show Notes:\u00A0 Documentary:  Broken: Inside the Toxic Culture of Canadian Gymnastics Melanie\u2019s story is included in this new documentary, now out on TSN.

      "description": "This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp. Dr. Marlene Winell\u00A0 knows all too well that exiting a controlling religion can trigger a devastating life crisis. As a college student, she moved away from the fire and brimstone fundamentalist Christianity she was raised in, and the fallout of her exodus was so dramatically upending that she felt compelled to dedicate her life\u2019s work to studying the very phenomenon that she\u2019d later coin:\u00A0 \u2018Religious Trauma Syndrome.\u2019 In this episode of A Little Bit Culty she chats with us about symptoms that arise in response to traumatic or stressful religious experiences, and what can be helpful along the road to recovery after leaving the fold.  More About Our Guest: Dr. Winell is a psychologist, educator, and writer whose background includes 30 years of experience in human services, in both community and academic settings. She holds a doctorate in Human Development and Family Studies from Pennsylvania State University and is the author of Leaving the Fold: A Guide for Former Fundamentalists and Others Leaving their Religion. Leaving the Fold has become a leading self-help book in the field of religious recovery - and examines the effects of authoritarian religion (namely fundamentalist Christianity) on individuals who leave the faith.\u00A0 She\u2019s also the founder of Journey Free organization, which is dedicated to helping people transition out of harmful religions, recover from trauma, and rebuild their lives. We\u2019ve developed programs for both individuals and groups. If you are recovering from religious harm, we have great respect for your strength and courage.

International attorney, humanitarian, author, and TEDx speaker Faith Jones (https://faithjones.com/)  was raised in this infamous cult founded by her paternal grandfather in 1968. The group, later referred to as \u201Cthe Family,\u201D was notorious for its radical practices, which required members to become fulltime missionaries, give up their income and formal education, and abide by the \u201CLaw of Love,\u201D a doctrine which encouraged spouse sharing, sexual relations with children, and the \u201CFlirty Fishing\u201D practice of using female followers as sex-bait to reel in followers. Thank gravy that Faith emancipated herself at 23, was later accepted into Berkeley Law school, and now travels the world advocating for everything that is NOT Children of God-like. She joins us in this first of two episodes to talk about Sex Cult Nun (http://sexcultnun.com/) , her scorching memoir of her life inside the secretive cult.

If you haven\u2019t listened to part one of our chat, stop what you\u2019re doing and back that ass up.

We caught up with Evan to talk about her journey to hell and back, how she\u2019s doing now, and why she won\u2019t ever stop blowing the whistle on complete fuckery. As a note to our listeners, and our lawyers, Mr. Manson has repeatedly denied the multiple sexual assault allegations from multiple women and is currently  suing Evan for defamation over the accusations, claiming it\u2019s all part of an elaborate organized attack. Please note that conversations like the one you\u2019re about to hear can be traumatizing for abuse survivors. Listen to this episode with caution, and if you or anyone you know needs support, see our site for free resources. Also please note that we love Evan Rachel Wood and believe her without reservation.

      "description": "Content Warning: Discussions of child abuse and sexual assault. Listener discretion advised. At just 24 years old, Sarah Landry found herself drawn to Hindu avatar Nithyananda\u2019s teachings like a fly to honey. Moldy, toxic honey. She quickly became an apt pupil, and then his top recruiter via a steady stream of stylized YouTube videos and camera-ready social content. But after learning that the rape and child abuse allegations dogging the organization were just too credible to simply swat away, she stepped down as its propagandist-in-chief and stepped up as one of its harshest critics. The fallout since she blew the whistle on the godman\u2019s shady ways in a series of incendiary 2019 Facebook posts and Youtube videos has been steep. (If you\u2019re labeled as a double-agent for the Vatican by loyalists of a guy who is on the lam after being charged with rape and abduction: You\u2019ve officially reached Remini-levels of cult busting.) In this episode, and the next\u2014there\u2019s just too much to cover to make it a one-parter\u2014Sarah shares what it\u2019s like to be on the other side of an army she helped build, and why she won\u2019t stop working to deplatform culty characters like Nithyananda no matter how many self-proclaimed island nations they pull out of their asses.

      "description": "\u201CWe were invisible. We had to be. We took an oath of absolute secrecy. We never even told our immediate families who we were. We went about our lives in New York City. Just like you. We were your accountants, money managers, lawyers, executive recruiters, doctors. We owned your child\u2019s private school and sold you your brownstone. But you\u2019d never guess our secret lives, how we lived in a kind of silent terror and fervor. There were hundreds of us.\u201D  That\u2019s a snippet from Spencer Schneider\u2019s compelling and creepy AF memoir: Manhattan Cult Story: My Unbelievable True Story of Sex, Crimes, Chaos, and Survival. This isn\u2019t an ad, it\u2019s just the truth: We think you\u2019re going to want to grab yourself a copy before you hit the beach this summer. It\u2019s that much of a page turner. In this episode of A Little Bit Culty, Spencer joins us to share more about what it was like living inside the nightmarish bubble of \u2018School\u2019, the ultra-secret Manhattan organization that consumed his life for 23 years. And just in case you\u2019ve not heard of  \u2018School\u2019, this particular culty shitshow gives us Eyes Wide Shut vibes with sprinklings of Eloise if she lived at The Plaza in the Upside Down. For extra credit, read up on  the late Sharon Gans, the eccentric School leader whose cult resume lowlights include: forced adoptions, arranged marriages, twisted displays of public humiliation and  conspicuous consumption, and  forced labor.

      "description": "Sarah and Nippy watched Holy Hell closely when they were exiting NXIVM back in 2016. It hit close to home: The documentary is an intimate look at the implosion of Buddhafield, a mysterious self-help cult formed by a charismatic character with an iffy backstory. In this episode, Sarah and Nippy welcome the film\u2019s director Will Allen to talk about what it was like to shine a light on Jaime Gomez, the so-called spiritual guru at the twisted heart of the group. Will didn\u2019t just film it all: he lived it. After joining Buddhafield as a freshly-minted film school grad, it consumed his world for twenty odd years with life-altering consequences. He was looking for a sense of community and purpose, but after the love bombing phase it was far from the blissed-out communal dream it was cracked up to be.  Five years after the film\u2019s release, Will chats with Sarah and Nippy about how he\u2019s doing now; his journey from unofficial in-house cult documentarian to whistleblower; and what it takes to disrupt patterns of abuse and coercive control in new agey circles. And be warned, dear listener, that this conversation delves into the same potentially triggering content that gave rise to Holy Hell\u2019s apt title. As told in the film via multiple victims\u2019 accounts, Gomez used weekly hypnotherapy sessions to sexually abuse and exploit young male devotees, Will among them.

If Part One\u2019s exploration of creepy AF Youtube spiritual guru Teal Swan didn\u2019t freak you out enough, there\u2019s more Teal talk for you in this episode. Be sure to watch The Deep End docuseries and binge The Gateway\u00A0 podcast to learn more about how each new layer of the Teal Tribe onion seems to be stankier than the last.. We recommend not listening or watching before bed, unless you really dig nightmares.  Despite what Teal may think: She isn\u2019t the center of the universe. She\u2019s not even the center of the cultiverse. So we also use part 2 of our chat with Jennings to ramble from the dark corners of Utah\u2019s Swan country to sunny Yuba County, California where the organization at the center of his  Revelations \u00A0podcast appears to be hard at work making fine wine and disturbing cult headlines.

      "description": "[Content Warning: This episode contains references to suicide, mental illness, and sexual assault. Listener discretion advised.] Youtube spiritual guru Teal Swan says she saves lives. Others say she\u2019s dangerously death-obsessed. We say she\u2019s serving strong \u201C9 Perfect Strangers\u201D villain vibes with a side order of night terrors. But that\u2019s just us. We wanted an expert\u2019s perspective, so we called on investigative journalist Jennings Brown for this episode to help us understand more about Teal\u2019s world. As a senior reporter at Gizmodo, Jennings traveled to rural Utah, the forests of Costa Rica, and smack dab into the middle of Teal\u2019s inner circle to understand her teachings and investigate the deaths of some of her followers.\u00A0  His unprecedented access to her group is at the heart of a six part podcast called  The Gateway - which we highly recommend as critical listening for anyone wanting to learn more about Teal\u2019s whole vibe from a safe distance. He joins us today to talk about the sharp edges woven into her carefully-curated, hypnotic image, and how spiritual hucksters are gaming the algorithm and manipulating people\u2019s most vulnerable moments. We also talk to him about his newest Spotify Original podcast series:  Revelations which follows a California cult that combines doomsday prophecies and fine wine. And TBH, we get so carried away that we go into extra innings. Enjoy this first episode with Jennings - and we\u2019ll be back next week with part two.\u00A0  Support the ALBC Pod: We\u2019ve made a link where you can support A Little Bit Culty with a one-time, weekly, or monthly contribution.

As a devoted member of the Remnant Fellowship, the Brentwood Tennessee church founded by the big-haired, charismatic Shamblin, Gina spent over a decade inside the group as a part of the music ministry team and as a poster child of sorts for the church\u2019s \u2018Weigh Down\u2019 diet method and weight loss empire. Gina joins us to talk in-depth about her experience in the church, the collateral damage to her family unit, and how she ultimately escaped Shamblin\u2019s clutches. She also shares how her faith has only deepened now that she\u2019s free from the Remnant Fellowship, and how she\u2019s coming back from years of spiritual abuse.

      "description": "As the voice of iconic cartoon characters, major TV networks, and national brands, Ian James Corlett has been heard by millions of people. But until now, he\u2019s never publicly rocked a mic to share his own story as an ex-Jehovah\u2019s Witness. Ian joins Sarah and Nippy for a rollicking ride through the denomination\u2019s history, and his journey from born-and-raised JW and church elder, to unapologetic apostate. He has a few choice things to say about why JWs appear to be leaving the denomination in droves, as well as some memories to share about that one time a fellow voice actor by the name of Sarah Edmondson tried to recruit him into NXIVM.  About Our Guest: You may have heard Ian James Corlett in the Emmy-nominated Dinosaur Train, in CartoonNetwork\u2019s zany Johnny Test, or in the latest Disney Jr hit: Vampirina. And going further back, Ian originated the iconic English dub voice of Goku in Dragonball Z as well as voicing other 90\u2019s icons such as Megaman, and Bob in Reboot.

Once upon a time, he also used this talking point on the regular as part of his top-rated keynote speaking gigs: \u0022To build an amazing company, it has to be a little bit more than a business, and a little bit less than a religion, it has to be in the zone of a cult.\u0022 Cameron joins Sarah and Nippy to talk about why he no longer stans that culty line of thinking, and how corporate culture routinely blurs the lines between community and coercion.\u00A0\n \n About Our Guest:\n Cameron Herold is the founder of the COO Alliance, author of 5 business books including Vivid Vision, and founder of the Invest In Your Leaders course. He\u0027s been paid to speak on all 7 continents including Antarctica\u2026and is the former COO of 1-800-GOT-JUNK? which was ranked the #2 company to work for in all of Canada, and became a case study at\u00A0 Harvard Business School, and landed him on Oprah.

      "description": "As a first year student at the University of Maryland, Lucy Taylor welcomed the sisterhood and built-in community that Greek life promised. But after accepting a bid into a \u2018top-tier\u2019 sorority, she left after seven months inside a toxic stew of rampant sexual assault, slut-shaming, misgogny, and racism. Lucy shared her experience in season one of her podcast, SNAPPED, and after an outpouring of responses she\u2019s continuing to use the series to help other former sorority and fraternity members share their all-too similar and all-too-horrific stories. On the cusp of spring, when Greek Week events and semi-formals are about to pop off on college campuses far and wide, Lucy joins Sarah and Nippy for an important conversation about the dangers of a beloved campus tradition. She shares why her experience in the panhellenic scene was hellish,\u00A0 and how the bait-and-switch recruitment tactics and gross coercive control methods that are rife throughout the Greek system are a whole bunch of culty. Before you ship your kids off to college, make sure you listen to this one.  About Lucy Taylor: Lucy Taylor is the creator, editor, producer, and host of SNAPPED, a podcast which explores the inner workings of sororities and fraternities on America\u2019s college campuses.

      "description": "A Little Bit Culty \u2013 We took zero breaks between seasons because we need you to hear this episode. Erin Robbins wasn\u2019t featured in Wild Wild Country, the 2018 Netflix Docuseries about Bhagawan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho. She lived it in real-time. She discovered the controversial guru\u2019s teachings at age 23 in 1977, and by the time he summoned her to his bedroom a year later for a \u2018special and secret\u2019 meeting that quickly devolved into a vile and violating encounter (the first of many) she thought he was the greatest spiritual master who\u2019d ever walked the planet. Erin disregarded her father, the co-founder, and owner of the Baskin-Robbins ice cream company, risking her family connection and inheritance in order to follow a man who would eventually lead his disciples into a world of murders, mass poisonings, and the gross sexual violation of children. After nearly 45 years of staying quiet, Erin is sharing her story after waking up just a year ago. This episode is full of potentially triggering content related to child abuse, coerced sterilization, and sexual assault. It also contains a staggering amount of bravery. Here\u2019s to the healing power of the truth.\u00A0  About Our Guest: Erin Robbins, M.Ed. is an award-winning artist who lives in Northern California.

      "description": "A Little Bit Culty \u2013 If the producers of Tiger King decide to make their next true crime show about you, you\u2019ve got a helluva story. Sarma Melngailis is the woman at the heart of \u201CBad Vegan\u201D the buzzworthy Netflix docu-series that chronicles her meteoric rise to fame, and her disturbing crash and burn from celebrity chef to fugitive. It\u2019s the stuff of clickbait gold, but beyond the headlines, there\u2019s usually more to it. And Sarma\u2019s story is, you guessed it: More than a little bit culty. We don\u2019t want to spoil anything, but there\u2019s a Keith Raniere-esque player involved in this epic fail. Sarma fell under the sway of a gambler with a criminal past who slid into her Twitter DMs with shady moves straight out of the NXIVM playbook, and then she married him. Cue the alleged gaslighting, sleep deprivation, and sexual humiliation. Pro-tip: If you\u2019ve come to believe that your pit bull is on the cusp of being made immortal: you\u2019ve probably been mindfucked. Sarma\u2019s got a lot to say now that those Netflix cameras aren\u2019t rolling, and she\u2019s only speaking to us.

Eric Skwarczynski is the host and creator of the Preacher Boys podcast, which is a platform for survivors\u2019 stories and the basis of an upcoming documentary film about a deeply disturbing pattern of sexual predation and abuse claims within\u00A0 the IFB. Eric joins us to talk about blowing the whistle on the IFB, what sucks about purity culture (hint: everything), and what it will take to create a sea change among current congregants, leaders, and pastors. He also gives us the scoop on his new podcast: Figuring it Out which currently features life advice from Shaq (!!!)  Also be warned: This episode contains graphic descriptions of child abuse and other completely fucking horrifying stuff. It will disturb you, and probably make you pretty irate. It made us shakey mad and more than a little sick to our stomachs to research this thing. (What the actual fuck, IFB. Get your shit together.)

This conversation was recorded several months ago, but it feels a bit prescient now that Putin is raining hellfire on Kyiv. The author, academic, and former Operating Thetan Section V chats with Sarah and Nippy about why it seems like psychopaths are running the world, and why he still has hope that humanity can turn things around in spite of itself.  \uFEFFAbout Jon Atack: Our guest today is one of the only court-appointed expert witnesses on Scientology, and his book:  Let\u2019s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky, about the early history of the church, is cited by academics all over the world. Jon was a \u2018public\u2019 Scientologist for nine years, trained as a counselor, and even did the secret \u2018OT\u2019 levels, but ditched it when he discovered appalling, aggressive behavior towards members. In addition to his work podcasting as a  Scientology mythbuster\u00A0 and using his Instagram account to help educate people on overcoming things like manipulation, destructive cults, and abusive relationships, he\u2019s written several novels, including  Voodoo Child (Slight Return), inspired by the life and downfall of Jimi Hendrix. By the look of all the fair gaming sites out there, he\u2019s also a Marvel-esque villain who deeply hurts Scientology\u2019s feelie weelies. This dastardly fellow lives in a charming village near Nottingham, England where, as Voltaire advised, he cultivates his garden. Exactly what a Marvel villain would do. ~ The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

These are the vibes that Bentinho Massaro is serving. He\u2019s got all the scary charisma and shiny trappings of a culty overachiever, like thousands of social media followers, a grandiose plan to build a fully enlightened society by 2035, and he even claims to vibrate at a higher frequency than other humans. He\u2019s also already achieved a rite of passage that\u2019s becoming all too common among culty fuckwads: His name in  headlines concerning the suspicious death of one of his followers at a  Sedona retreat.  Our trio of guests in this double episode whistleblower extravaganza are coming forward to call bullshit on Bentinho\u2019s special brand of mindfuckery. Jade Alectra, Keilan McNeil, and Jacqueline Graham were pulled into his mad world, and got themselves out. But they aren\u2019t going radio silent. Oh hell no.

We\u2019re not labeling the organization at the heart of this episode a cult, but we are asking our guest Keely Griffin if loving and leaving Twin Flames Universe was the bad trip that reports published by  Vanity Fair,\u00A0Vice, and  Daily Mail make it sound. Once a devotee of TFU, Keely shares what made the YouTubey, Facebooky spiritual community sound promising at first, just how quickly it went to the Upside Down, and how she\u2019s coming back from the whole shitshow now that she\u2019s out of its grips.  Oh and just FYI, the list of what TFU officially disputes about its bad press practically writes our show notes for us: They dispute that they promote harassment and stalking. They dispute that they engage in exploitative and cult-like practices. They dispute that they coerce members into changing their gender. A Little Bit Culty, on the other hand, does not dispute that the whole TFU vibe makes us want to throw up in our mouths a little bit.

In Part 2, he shares what happened during his last conversation with Keith Raniere, how he\u2019s defragged his brain since he helped burn ol\u2019 Dead Eyes\u2019 playhouse down, and what the bleep he\u2019s working on next. Oh, and there is bountiful ass-chapping.  More about today\u2019s guest:\u00A0 Author, speaker, and award-winning director Mark Vicente was behind the sleeper hit \u201CWhat The Bleep Do We Know?!\u201D Born in South Africa in 1965, Mark took his first photograph at age four and discovered his passion for being behind the camera. After working his way up the ranks of the camera department, his first big break came as Cinematographer on the musical \u201CSARAFINA,\u201D starring Whoopi Goldberg. In 1992, he relocated to Los Angeles to shoot his first studio picture for Disney entitled \u201CFATHERHOOD\u201D From a very young age he found himself propelled to question beliefs about the human condition. His filmmaking activism led him to make a number of films, including \u2018Encender el Corazon\u2019, about the rampant kidnapping epidemic in Mexico. It was a bittersweet victory; the film touched people deeply, but was by association supporting NXIVM.\u00A0 He made the difficult decision to pull the film from distribution and, with a small band of whistleblowers, expose their criminal enterprise.\u00A0  Mark\u2019s since developed a keen\u00A0 interest in exposing the coercive and duplicitous environments of high-control groups. His memoir: \u2018QUEST\u2019 or \u2018How the BLEEP did that happen?!\u2019 will be released shortly. It chronicles the many untold stories of what occurred in NXIVM , as well as he and his wife Bonnie\u2019s harrowing campaign to escape and expose the organization.\u00A0 He\u2019s also in production on a film about malignant narcissism, narcissistic abuse, and trauma bonding which exposes abusive strategies.

      "description": "A Little Bit Culty \u2013\n If you think you\u2019re too smart to fall for a cult, this episode is your wake-up call. Undue influence can poison what starts out as a \u2018good thing\u2019 and turn it into a culty shitshow. Just ask today\u2019s guest: Gerette Buglion. She was a member of an under-the-radar cult for over 18 years. In this organization, there was no tithing, no rules about where you should live, what brand of deodorant you must use, or what clothes to wear. Instead, far more subtle techniques were used...but they were powerful, and destructive all the same. When Gerette finally emerged from the cult at age 52, she asked herself, \u201CHow did I, an educated, caring mother, wife, and business owner become that lost and for that long?\u201D She joins us to discuss her page-turning memoir, and her journey from hopeful therapy client to enthusiastic cult member to an anti-cult crusader. Spoiler alert: You\u2019re not too smart to fall for culty shit.\u00A0\n \n More about today\u2019s guest: Gerette Buglion, B.A. Elementary Education and Special Education, earned her \u2018Master\u0027s Degree\u2019 in cult awareness education from the school of life. This training occurred during her eighteen-year odyssey with Doug (Fictitious name. Real person) who was the leader of the \u2018Center for Transformational Learning\u2019 (fictitious name for a real group, also simply CTL). Her memoir of her experience,  An Everyday Cult, lifts the nuanced veil of controlling groups through its subtle weaving of personal experience with insight from recognized cultic phenomena. In addition to hosting retreats and her Writing to Reckon workshops, Gerette is a co-founding collaborator of the #igotout movement and igotout.org and co-host of the  Everyday Cults, Everyday People \u00A0podcast.

      "description": "A Little Bit Culty \u2013 Consent is one of the most misunderstood words of all time, and in the confusion surrounding it, bad actors find loopholes. According to today\u2019s guests, defining consent in penal code is key to prosecuting sex crimes and preventing sexual assaults. Joyce Short has fought to define consent for over a decade. A sexual assault survivor, she has written 3 books on the subject. Her most recent, \u0022Your Consent - The Key to Conquering Sexual Assault,\u0022 lay the foundation for New York\u0027s current bills, #A6540 and #S6200, defining \u0022consent\u0022 in penal law. She is a TEDx Talk Presenter and the Founder and Director of the Consent Awareness Network (CAN): A coalition whose mission is to correctly define consent for society and to properly define it in laws and statutes across the US and around the world. She joins the podcast today with CAN Chief of Staff and Consent Outreach Ambassador Nina Lucas to talk about bill A6540, a piece of legislation currently in committee in New York state that seeks to define consent and clarify the definition of lawful sexual conduct.  Today\u2019s episode wraps Season One of A Little Bit Culty with the opposite of word salad around the issue of consent, followed by a clear call to action: Spread the word about #FGKIA, help bill A6540 get out of committee, and help define consent.\u00A0 Learn more at: Assembly Bill A6540   Sign The Petition Consent Awareness Network Joyce\u2019s TedTalk Joyce\u2019s Book  Follow Joyce on Instagram\u00A0  Follow Nina on TikTok  Follow Nina on Instagram  Don\u2019t get it twisted: The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

      "description": "A Little Bit Culty \u2013 Daniel Shaw, LCSW, checks every imaginable box on A Little Bit Culty\u2019s dream guest checklist. He\u2019s a psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City and in Nyack, New York. He originally trained as an actor at Northwestern University and with the renowned teacher Uta Hagen in New York City, and later worked as a missionary for an Indian guru. His eventual recognition of cultic aspects of this organization led him to become an outspoken activist in support of individuals and families traumatically abused in cults. Simultaneous with leaving this group, Dan began his training in the mental health profession, becoming a faculty member and supervisor at the National Institute for the Psychotherapist in New York. His book, Traumatic Narcissism: Relational Systems of Subjugation, was published by Routledge in 2014 and was nominated for the distinguished Gradiva Award.  In 2018, the International Cultic Studies Association awarded him the Margaret Thaler Singer Award for advancing the understanding of coercive persuasion and undue influence. Shaw\u2019s book Traumatic Narcissism and Recovery: Leaving the Prison of Shame and Fear will be published by Routledge in 2021. Dan joined Sarah and Nippy to share his story, drop some knowledge about the shameless ways of traumatizing narcissists, and provide insights on the recovery process.

And if by chance you wake up to what\u0027s inherently terrible about it, and manage to escape that thinking, how do you then seek redemption? In 2017, Samantha Freedom was the top ranking woman leader in Identity Evropa, the white nationalist organization behind the violent Charlottesville, Virginia \u2018Unite the Right\u2019 rally that resulted in the death of 20 year old Heather Heyer. That event was when Samantha\u2019s descent into white supremacy, something she\u2019s described as a \u2018fever dream,\u2019 finally began to break. Samantha joins Sarah and Nippy for a frank and sometimes painful conversation about her journey in and out of the alt-right, and why she\u2019s nowhere near done when it comes to making things right.

With so much happening at rapidfire pace in the culti-verse, A Little Bit Culty lit up the Bat signal and Matthew Remski of the Conspirituality podcast answered. He\u2019s an author, an investigative journalist, and a dad who also happens to be a two-time survivor of yoga-related cults. And if you know the Conspirituality podcast, you know that he and his co-hosts offer a weekly master class on a whole venn diagram of cults, conspiracy theories, new age charlatans, and the darkest fringes of the spiritual marketplace.\u00A0  Matthew joins Sarah and Nippy for an episode that delves into his journey from cult survivor to expert, and his advice for navigating the strange position of doing cult recovery on the world stage. They also cover cultic abuse in the digital age, toxic Kundalini gurus, and why it\u2019s high time for a few phrases related to cult discourse to be updated for 2021.

But if you don\u2019t know her story, just know this: She was way ahead of the curve on calling bullshit Keith Raniere and his flying monkeys. She also paid dearly for it.\u00A0 In this episode, Sarah and Nippy reconnect with Susan to talk in-depth about her role as one of the original \u201CNXIVM 9,\u201D what her healing process looks like these days, and why she torched her proctor sashes.

It still is. As Nippy says: \u201CShe\u0027s someone who has been through (her own) heavy duty cult indoctrination, woken up, gotten her way out. She\u0027s kept on going. She\u0027s dedicated her life to helping other people understand how cults operate and how to come back from them.\u201D In this episode, Sarah and Nippy reconnect with Dr. Lalich for a conversation about her journey from cult member to author-expert, and her insights on NXIVM\u2019s now incarcerated founder, Keth Raniere. They also explore what leads people into abusive dynamics, what can pull them back in, and tools for getting back on track.\u00A0\n About Dr. Lalich: Janja Lalich, Ph.D. is a researcher, author, and educator specializing in cults and extremist groups, with a particular focus on charismatic relationships, political and other social movements, ideology and social control, and issues of gender and sexuality.

Mike Rinder was born and raised in Scientology and rose to the very top of the church\u2019s worldwide hierarchy to become its international spokesperson and head of Special Affairs for over 20 years. But when he escaped the organization in 2007, he cut his losses; leaving with only a briefcase and the clothes on his back. In this episode, Mike joins Sarah and Nippy to talk about the trail he blazed out of Scientology, the ongoing work of whistleblowing, and what it\u2019s like to be a dissident when you\u2019re going up against a monolith. They also do a deep dive on Scientology dogma, the next-level mindfuckery in the L. Ron Hubbard and Keith Raniere playbooks, and the joys of post-cult living.\u00A0 About Mike Rinder: Mike\u2019s unique voice and perspective has inspired people around the world. As a well-known whistleblower exposing abuses in Scientology, he\u2019s teamed up with Leah Remini for the groundbreaking, Emmy-winning A\u0026E series Scientology and the Aftermath, and the Scientology: Fair Game podcast.

      "description": "A Little Bit Culty \u2013 What\u2019s the difference between a cult and something that\u2019s just a little bit culty? What should Sarah and Nippy tell their kids when they\u2019re old enough to ask about NXIVM? How do you protect yourself from mind control? On this episode of A Little Bit Culty, our co-hosts chat with cult expert and author Dr. Steven Hassan about what makes people universally vulnerable to undue influence and cultic abuse; how to spot red flags; and some of the striking similarities between Keith Raniere and Donald Trump. They also explore Dr. Hassan\u2019s cult origin story as a former member of the Moon cult, as well as his groundbreaking BITE Model that demystifies the methods that cults deploy to recruit and maintain control over people. Sarah also shares a (ahem) juicy story about a WTF moment of truth about a certain dietary mystery among the women of NXIVM that always perplexed her.  About Dr. Steven Hassan: As one of the world\u2019s leading authorities on cults, Dr. Steven Hassan has been helping people wake up, leave, and heal from cultic abuse for over forty years as a mental health professional, consultant, and educator. He is the founding director of the Freedom of Mind Resource Center, an organization that specializes in providing acute intensive care for people exiting destructive environments. Dr. Hassan is also the author of four books, including Combating Cult Mind Control, Freedom of Mind, and most recently: The Cult of Trump. About the BITE Model, as quoted from the Freedom of Mind Resource center site at Freedomofmind.com: \u201CBased on research and theory by Robert Jay Lifton, Margaret Singer, Edgar Schein, Louis Jolyon West, and others who studied brainwashing in  Maoist China as well as cognitive dissonance theory by Leon Festinger, Steven Hassan developed the BITE Model to describe the specific methods that cults use to recruit and maintain control over people.\u00A0\u201CBITE\u201D stands for Behavior, Information, Thought, and Emotional control.

The pair share the story of how the A Little Bit Culty podcast came to be, and state some intentions and ground rules up front. Namely, as co-hosts of the podcast, they don\u2019t want to be in the business of punching down on people who are still in cults. They also state their mission to be as responsible as possible with the platform, and to help other people by having the honest, informed conversations they wish they\u2019d heard when they were in NXIVM.\u00A0  Sarah and Nippy also discuss how the experience of leaving NXIVM has affected their relationship and their outlook now: especially in the aftermath of Keith Raniere\u2019s conviction and 120 year prison sentence. They also tackle some burning questions from people who\u2019ve followed their story closely: Did Keith ever hit on Sarah? Where did Nippy get his name? Are you still friends with anyone from NXIVM, and do you ever want to talk to Lauren or Nancy again? Then they wrap it all up by sharing a few of the less headline-worthy things that really chapped their ass about NXIVM: from the organization\u2019s flying monkeys and fixers, to\u00A0 office politics and full-on interoffice polyamory.

      "description": "A Little Bit Culty \u2013 Don\u2019t call her a #bossbitch. She\u2019s the boss, bitch. Roberta Blevins was a Trainer with LuLaRoe, had a team of 75 women under her, and made over $65,000 in bonuses alone. But when she came to the conclusion that it was a rigged, losing game she didn\u2019t just leave the business: she testified in the Washington State vs. LuLaRoe Pyramid Scheme lawsuit as a witness for the state. The fan favorite from the buzzed-about LuLaRich docuseries sits down for an A Little Bit Culty chat with Sarah and Nippy about what it\u2019s like when MLM gold turns to mold, the similarities between LuLaRoe and NXIVM, and the truth about those buttery soft leggings.  Since leaving MLM, Roberta has educated herself on the systemic structure of the business model, the psychological manipulation, the seedy underbelly and governmental ties, the cult indoctrination, and the history of Multi Level Marketing. She educates daily on TikTok, and podcasts in her \u0022free time\u0022 on her own podcast, Life After MLM, which explores the dangers of Multi Level Marketing through the eyes of the victims and survivors. Her work has been featured on Amazon Prime Video, Vice Media, Bloomberg News, Split, and Business Insider among others.
