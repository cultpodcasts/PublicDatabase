      "description": "Why does a city as small as Battle Creek have such a long and intense history of religious fervor and cult activity, and why does it persist into the present day? In this video we cover the origins of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, the history of the Kellogg family, the regional influence on the development of the Urantia Book, and take a look at the presence of the Federal Government in the small city of Battle Creek.\n\nfollow me on twitter @facebookvillain \nsupport the channel @ https://ko-fi.com/doinkwizard\ncheck out my podcasts Beep Beep Lettuce and Work Stoppage",
