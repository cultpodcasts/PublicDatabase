      "title": "I Was Raised In A Satanic Cult | Surviving Hell with Kibbi Linga",
      "description": "Kibbi was born into a satanic cult led by her mother. Her family hid behind the cover of religion and would use inversions of religion as an excuse to perpetuate abuse. As a child she says she was forced to watch and partake in human sacrifices, as well as incest. Kibbi told herself as a child that she would one day get away, be an artist, and expose her mother - and after years of being silenced, that is exactly what she is doing. Listener discretion is advised and this episode is not suitable for children.\n\nThank you to our sponsors!\nSqueezed Juice | Use code \u0022ALEX\u0022 for 25% OFF at https://shop.squeezedjuice.com\n\u2060Zebra\u2060 | Use code \u0022ALEX for 10% OFF any order at https://www.yayzebra.com\nGarnuu | Use code \u201CALEX\u201D for 15% OFF at https://www.garnuu.com\nGood Ranchers\u2060\u2060 | Use code \u201CCLARK\u201D for an additional $25 off your first box and free express shipping at https://www.goodranchers.com\nAleavia | Use code \u0022ALEX15\u0022 15% OFF at https://www.aleavia.com\n\nKibbi Linga \n\u0022She Got Away\u0022 Podcast | https://www.youtube.com/@shegotawaypodcast\n\u0022She Got Away\u0022 Podcast | https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/she-got-away-podcast/id1746591150\nInstagram | https://www.instagram.com/kibbi.linga\nInstagram Art | https://www.instagram.com/kibbi.linga.art/?hl=en\nTik Tok | https://www.tiktok.com/@kibbi.linga\nX (Twitter) | https://x.com/KibbiLinga\n\nResources provided by Kibbi\nIf you are a victim of abuse, call the 24 hour Sexual Assault Hotline (RAINN) 800-656-HOPE \n\u0022The Imagination Podcast\u0022 |  https://rumble.com/c/TheImaginationPodcast\nMary Knight Testimony | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmqOiqRFcE0\nNathan Reynolds Testimony | https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=nathan\u002Breynolds\n\nAlex Clark \nInstagram | https://www.instagram.com/realalexclark\nInstagram | https://www.instagram.com/poplitics\nFacebook |  https://www.facebook.com/realalexclark\nX (Twitter) | https://x.com/yoalexrapz\nYouTube | https://www.youtube.com/@RealAlexClark\nSpotify | https://open.spotify.com/show/7M0C7cl5Fobejy7gbT5GB2?si=4c1abfaf22314ff8\nApple Podcasts | https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-spillover-with-alex-clark/id1507839530\n\n\u0027Culture Apothecary\u0027 Merch OUT NOW!
