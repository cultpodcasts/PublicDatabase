We\u2019re gonna meet invisible CIA agents, matchmaking, fake illnesses, Jan Levinson\u2019s cousin (not really), drinking blood, and\u2026more deaths. Haven\u0027t tried Magic Mind yet?

      "description": "The episode where Lindsey brings us some true crime but surprise! It\u2019s a two parter and involves a cult, so make sure you tune in next week for the conclusion. This is also the episode where the Sarahs converts every C to S, so really this is the cult of Conscious Development\u2026or the sult of Sonscious Development. Try to keep up here. This lesser known cult has it all: bloodletting, suspicious wills, and zero critical thinking skills. www.thetipsyghost.com Find us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok @thetipsyghost.
