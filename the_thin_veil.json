      "title": "The Kenyan Preacher who Led Hundreds to their Deaths | The Shakahola Cult",
      "description": "This video covers the Shakahola Forest tragedy and the rise of Paul Mackenzie, the preacher behind Kenya\u2019s most notorious doomsday cult. In this true crime documentary, we explore how Mackenzie, founder of Good News International Ministries, convinced hundreds of followers to abandon their lives and move into an isolated forest settlement, leading to one of the deadliest cult incidents in modern history.\n\nWe dive into Mackenzie\u2019s early life, his radical preaching, and the terrifying beliefs that pushed his followers toward extreme isolation in the name of salvation. Learn how fear, manipulation, and promises of spiritual purity spiraled into a national tragedy that left hundreds dead and many more missing.\n\nThis in-depth look at the Shakahola cult is a chilling reminder of how dangerous charismatic leaders can become when unchecked.\n\nThis video is for educational purposes only.\n\nLike, comment and subscribe!\n\nWant to support the channel?

      "description": "The Penza Recluses were members of a fanatical cult that set up their own church in the 2000\u0027s called the True Russian Orthodox church in a small Russian Village. This short documentary follows the story of it\u0027s founder Pyotr Kuznetsov who convinced his followers that doomsday was fast approaching and they needed to await the end of times out in a cave to survive. Kuznetsov and his cult disavowed all technology, processed foods and communication with anyone outside of the group. The actions of Pyotr and his followers led to tragic outcomes for some but even after that, some of his followers remained faithful to their radical beliefs. \n\nLike, comment and subscribe!\n \n#solvedmysteries \n\nWant to support the channel? \n\nLeave me a tip: https://ko-fi.com/thethinveil\n\n--\nStock footage and images from Pexels and Pixabay and Creative Commons\n\nIntro stinger:\n\u25BACinematic Trailer - LiteSaturation from Pixabay\n\u25BAhttps://pixabay.com/service/license-summary/\n\nMusic:\n\u25BADark Forest by McFunkypants\n\u25BAThe Crypt by Myuu",
