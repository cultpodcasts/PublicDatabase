      "description": "In this episode of the H.J. Talks About Abuse podcast, Alan Collins, head of the Hugh James abuse team, delves into the harrowing findings of the Keith Makin report. The report reveals the Church of England\u0027s longstanding cover-up of the abusive actions of the late John Smyth QC, a prominent lawyer and part-time judge.\nJohn Smyth, who was heavily involved in evangelical Christianity, is accused of physically, sexually, emotionally, and spiritually abusing numerous boys and young men in England and Zimbabwe. Despite being confronted about his actions as early as 1982, Smith continued his abuse for decades, shielded by the Church\u0027s inaction and failure to report his crimes to the authorities.\nThis episode critically examines the Church of England\u0027s systemic failures in safeguarding, the disturbing minimisation of abuse, and the need for justice and atonement for Smyth\u0027s victims. As Alan Collins discusses these issues, he emphasises the importance of empowering survivors and ensuring their voices are heard.\nListeners are urged to reflect on the Church\u0027s responsibilities and the broader implications of institutional cover-ups in cases of abuse.

      "description": "Welcome to this insightful podcast brought to you by Alan Collins, the head of the abuse team at Hugh James. As he explores the current stance on child abuse reporting, he dives into the necessity of mandatory reporting and the implications of non-enforcement. Alan underscores the need for a law that requires individuals aware of child abuse to report the incident to the police or relevant authorities. Alan discerns the substantial gaps in the existing system, noting that the majority of Western countries have enforcement laws, but a large portion have no legal obligation to report child abuse. He refers to a publicized Home Office announcement, revealing the introduction of new legal requirements for those in positions of responsibility to report known child sexual abuse. Through the discussion, Alan expresses his concerns about the current arrangements. He encourages rigorous reporting of any suspicions or concerns about child abuse, stating that waiting until after abuse has been confirmed equates to shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted. Drawing from experience, Alan elaborates on the real-world repercussions of neglecting to report child abuse and observes the lack of accountability evident in public failure. As a solution, he advocates for the establishment of more effective mandatory reporting laws that would bring about significant culture changes, minimizing future instances of abuse. Alan concludes the podcast by voicing his intention to bring up this issue again at Parliament in the following month and continues to hope for decisive strides in establishing more beneficial laws governing mandatory reporting of child abuse. He makes the point that these laws should cover a wide range of adults working with children and not be exclusive to teachers and health professionals.

      "description": "Former pope Benedict XVI of the Roman Catholic Church has admitted providing false information to the German inquiry into clerical sexual abuse. The report found Benedict whilst in his role of the Archbishop of Munich and Freising from 1977-1982 failed to take action against four priests accused of sexual abuse. Benedict stated initially he was not at a meeting in the 1980\u2019s which discussed allegations of abuse and that it was deemed by him as an oversight. An investigation found he was in fact involved in such meeting and was aware of the allegations. This allowed the perpetrators in question to remain in their positions within the church without sanction or supervision. As Pope between 2005 and 2013, Benedict has previously come under fire for failing to act against widespread child sexual abuse within the Roman Catholic church and has repeatedly denied his role in knowingly covering up abuse, although in 2010 he admitted that the church \u201Cdid not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action\u201D. A previous report into historical abuse in Germany concluded that more than 3,600 people nationwide had been abused by clergy members between 1946 and 2014. Many of the survivors were very young and served as altar boys. Again as with any reported figures, these numbers are likely to be the tip of the iceberg with many survivors not disclosing their abuse. The report, like many before them, is disappointing and once again demonstrates the failures of the church to protect those in the congregation. It will be very upsetting for many who could have been protected by the church. We encourage anyone who has concerns about sexual abuse to get in touch.
