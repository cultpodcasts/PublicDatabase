      "title": "How a Michigan Cult Leader Ended Up in a Glass Coffin Filled with Treasure",
      "description": "In Benton Harbor, Michigan, a cult leader named Benjamin Purnell promised his followers eternal life...as long as they gave up everything they owned and lived by his rules. His group, the House of David, became infamous for strict celibacy, lavish mansions, and mysterious rituals. But when Purnell died of tuberculosis in 1927, chaos erupted. To keep the illusion alive, his followers placed him in a hermetically sealed glass coffin inside the colony\u2019s Diamond House mansion.\n\nFor decades, locals whispered about \u201Cthe man in the glass coffin\u201D and the treasures buried with him. The House of David itself began to fade, but its strangest relic, a cult leader on display in his tomb, only fueled the legend. Then in 1988, thieves smashed through the mansion\u2019s walls. What they found looked like a pharaoh\u2019s burial chamber: diamonds, gold, priceless art, and the body of Benjamin Purnell himself.\n\nThe robbery made national news, and while most of the stolen items were recovered, the cult leader\u2019s massive 22-carat diamond ring and jeweled medallion vanished forever. To this day, the story of the House of David and the man in the glass coffin remains one of Michigan\u2019s most bizarre pieces of history.\n\n\uD83C\uDFA7 Want to see more?
