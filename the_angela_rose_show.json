      "description": "What happens when obedience becomes survival, and silence is enforced through fear of eternal damnation?\n\n\n\nIn this episode of The Angela Rose Show, I sit down with Michelle Stewart, activist, survivor, and author of JUDAS GIRL. Michelle grew up moving through a series of religious cults, including Hutterite, Bruderhof, River Brethren, Russian Orthodox, and an off-grid Amish-style commune led by a former Pathway Publishing editor. Each group claimed to hold \u201Ctruth,\u201D but used fear, shame, and religious coercion to suppress identity, voice, and thought.\n\n\n\n\uD83D\uDD0D We explore:\n\nWhy Michelle used the word cult, and what actually qualifies as one\nGender hierarchy, obedience, and early objectification in Hutterite and Bruderhof life\nThe psychological toll of being called \u201Cworse than Judas\u201D by her father at age 14\nHer struggle to reconcile faith, autonomy, and loyalty as a teenage church member\nThe role purity culture played in grooming, coercion, and sexual violation\nHow indoctrination prevented her from recognizing abuse, and her own worth\nThe impact of untreated mental illness and betrayal within religious systems\nThe life-saving power of education, language, and the right resources\n\n\nMichelle\u2019s story is one of surviving impossible choices, reclaiming power, and choosing to name the truth, even when it\u2019s not welcome. As she says in the episode:\n\n\n\n\u201CYou can only make choices from the mindset you know.\u201D\n\n\n\n\uD83D\uDCD5 Her memoir JUDAS GIRL doesn\u2019t offer a tidy ending.. It offers validation, insight, and a path toward clarity.\n\n\n\n\uD83D\uDED1 Trigger warning: This episode includes honest discussions of sexual abuse, spiritual manipulation, and suicide ideation. Please take care as you listen.\n\n\n\n\uD83D\uDCAC If something in this conversation resonates with your story, comment below or message privately.

We\u2019re not just talking about healing today, we\u2019re talking about thriving. About reclaiming agency, success, and voice after a lifetime of compliance and oppression. \n\n\n\nComing from Amish and Mennonite cultures where entrepreneurship was \u201Ca man\u2019s lane,\u201D Jess and I open up about what it really means to launch a business as a woman from a high-control religious environment. This isn\u2019t about hustle culture. It\u2019s about health, ownership, and self respect. It\u0027s about choosing courage over what mind control had instilled in us.\n\n\n\n\uD83D\uDD0D We unpack:\n\nThe loneliness of stepping into your potential\nHow gender role expectations didn\u0027t work for us and why we broke those rules\nThe painful loss of relationships when we stopped struggling and started thriving\nWriting as reclamation: turning our stories into strength\nWhy success as a survivor is revolutionary\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever felt like your healing or ambition made others uncomfortable, this episode is for you. \n\n\uD83D\uDCAC Drop a comment, share your story, or just know this: you\u2019re not too much.

      "description": "In today\u2019s episode of The Angela Rose Show, I sit down with someone I deeply admire \u2014 Jessica Witmer of Wild Olive Branch Coaching. This is her story as a teenager, but it\u2019s also the story of so many of us who grew up silenced, oppressed, and searching for safety in high-control religious environments.\n\n\n\nJessica was raised in an Amish household with 15 siblings, a strict environment, with emotional neglect and physical abuse that ran deep. She opens up about being the \u201Coutsider\u201D in a church she would never be fully accepted into, dissociation and self-harm, and the unbearable shame that engulfed her for years. Her courage to revisit her teenage years and speak so vulnerably is nothing short of stunning.\n\n\n\nWe talked about what it\u2019s like to wake up from survival mode and realize you\u2019ve never been taught how to live. How even after escaping abuse, the battle isn\u0027t over\u2014it just changes. Jessica shares what helped her begin to heal, the poem she wrote that still gives me chills, and the powerful meaning behind her \u201CI think you should stay\u201D hat and self harm transformation tatoo.\n\n\n\n\uD83D\uDCAC What we dive into:\n\nJessica\u2019s experience growing up Amish and feeling like an outsider\nSelf inflicted violence, and how it became a way of coping\nHow she escaped her abusive home at 17 \nWhat healing actually looked like\u2026 messy, non-linear, and painfully beautiful\nWhy her scars and her story no longer carries shame\n\n\nIf you are struggling with your mental health, I hope this episode reminds you: there is nothing wrong with you. You were never the problem. And you are absolutely worthy of compassion and recovery. I think you should stay.\n\n\n\n\uD83D\uDDA4 Follow Jessica:\n\nInstagram: @wildolivebranchcoaching\n\nFacebook: @jessicawitmer\n\nCoaching \u0026 Support: Search Wild Olive Branch Coaching\n\n\n\n\uD83C\uDF99\uFE0F Follow me (Angela Rose):\n\nInstagram: @angelarosemartin\n\nFacebook: @angelarosemartin\n\nTikTok: @angelaroseshow\n\n\n\n\uD83D\uDD14 Subscribe for more real stories from survivors who\u2019ve turned pain into purpose.\n\n\n\n\u2764\uFE0F If You Need Immediate Help\n\n\n\n\uD83D\uDCCD CRISIS SUPPORT RESOURCES\n\nCrisis Text Line \u2013 Text TWLOHA to 741741\n\nSuicide \u0026 Crisis Lifeline \u2013 Call 988\n\nNational Child Abuse Hotline \u2013 Call 800-422-4453\n\nNational Domestic Violence Hotline \u2013 Call 800-799-7233\n\nRAINN (Rape, Abuse \u0026 Incest National Network) \u2013 Call 800-656-4673\n\n\n\nYou matter.

In this episode, we go there. The hard parts. The invisible wounds. The parts nobody wants to talk about in church. \n\nWe unpack:\n-How self-abandonment starts early in religious trauma\n-How fear and shame are baked into obedience\n-How abuse doesn\u2019t always leave bruises\u2014but always leaves impact\n-The grief of discovering what was done to you was never your fault\n-And how reconnecting with your body changes everything \n\nThis isn\u2019t surface-level healing.

Together, we unravel the weight of twisted love messages, the cost of silence, and what it means to reclaim the parts of yourself once stolen.\n\nWe talk about the long-term impact of childhood rape, the tangled lines between church and God, and how healing doesn\u2019t always look like a testimony with a pretty ending. Ann  shares how her tattoos became symbols of resilience, authenticity, and ownership of her own body.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever felt silenced, confused by love, or blamed for your pain, this space is for you.\n\nWe are not here to perform healing. We\u2019re here to tell the truth, even when it\u2019s still unfinished.\n\n\uD83D\uDD4A Subscribe for more unfiltered stories from survivors.
