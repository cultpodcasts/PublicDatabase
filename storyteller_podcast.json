      "description": "Part Two is Here!! The Making of Warren Jeffs\n Content warning: discussion of abuse, child abuse, and spiritual coercion.\nBefore he became the self-proclaimed Prophet of the FLDS and one of America\u2019s most notorious cult leaders, Warren Jeffs was just a boy born into chaos \u2014 the \u201Cgolden child\u201D of a sprawling polygamist family and the son of the church\u2019s future prophet.\nIn this episode, we trace how a quiet, awkward teacher turned into the architect of absolute control. From the turmoil of the Jeffs household to his years running Alta Academy, we uncover the blueprint of obedience, isolation, and fear that would later define his reign.\nThrough survivor accounts, family testimonies, and chilling early patterns of abuse, we explore how Warren learned to manipulate faith itself \u2014 turning devotion into domination.\n\uD83C\uDFA7 This is The Making of Warren Jeffs \u2014 Part Two of our FLDS series.\n\n\nMusic used :\u00A0 \u0022 SINISTER \u0022 composed and produced by \u0022Vivek Abhishek\u0022\nMusic link : https://youtu.be/s7_oukTEFrc\nSUBSCRIBE us on YOUTUBE: https://bit.ly/3qumnPH\nFollow on Facebook: https://bit.ly/33RWRtP\nFollow on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2ImU2JV\nReferences:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Jeffs\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna30016991\nhttps://www.deseret.com/2006/8/29/19971153/the-rise-of-warren-jeffs/\nhttps://local.sltrib.com/charts/jeffstimeline/timeline.html\nhttps://www.deseret.com/2006/8/30/19971276/from-nerd-to-flds-chief/\nhttps://local.sltrib.com/upload/2010/11/1288813415awantedman.pdf\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/81292539\nhttps://www.peacocktv.com/watch-online/tv/preaching-evil-a-wife-on-the-run-with-warren-jeffs/8910741537945005112\n\n\nSupport the show\nIf you enjoy the stories we tell and want to help us keep bringing them to life, you can support the podcast here:\n \n \uD83D\uDD17 https://www.buzzsprout.com/2535436/support\n\n\n Every contribution goes directly back into the show \u2014 from research and recording to editing and equipment.
