Now, she joins The Mitchell Report Unleashed Podcast to discuss her book, the importance of nervous system regulation, and the profound personal growth she\u2019s achieved through storytelling. Born into an ultra-religious cult\u2014known as \u0022the Field\u0022\u2014Michelle spent her childhood on a mountain in the Angeles National Forest. The group was founded in the 1930s by her grandfather, a domineering and charismatic figure who convinced generations of followers that he would live for 500 years and ascend to heaven upon doomsday. In this harsh environment, comfort and care were considered sins. Michelle was forced to endure hunger, thirst, and cold, learning survival skills that most could never imagine. She grew to trust animals more than people and developed an unbreakable connection to the natural world\u2014lessons that would shape her resilience in the years to come.
