      "description": "Born into the FLDS and married as teenagers, Ange and Cade\u2019s story reads like a slow-burning escape: ritualized control, a prophet\u2019s death, and a community split that left them adrift. When rebellion and heartbreak push them apart, two restless youths choose very different paths\u2014one into the unbridled thrill of apostasy, the other into a furious search for meaning. Together they unlearn a lifetime of rules, rebuild their lives, and begin to parent and love on their own terms. This episode traces the ache and the light: the trauma of coercion, the tenderness of small mercies, and the fierce work of healing. It\u2019s an intimate, hopeful portrait of two people who refused to let a closed world define their future\u2014and who now tell their story to help others find the courage to leave.",
