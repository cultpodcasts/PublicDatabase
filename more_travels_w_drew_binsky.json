I spent an entire day with Jesus, asking him questions, meeting his followers and really trying to get a grasp on his life. Little did I know that Jesus himself would invite me over to his house for dinner! Here is the full story and experience :)\n\nFollow @MoreTravelsWithDrewBinsky  for more stories from EVERY country, and join me on https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nWatch the documentary that I made about Jesus Christ and his cult here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejwj5atUxF4\n\nFollow my travels on Instagram! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n------\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I\u0027ve been to all 197 countries in the world.
