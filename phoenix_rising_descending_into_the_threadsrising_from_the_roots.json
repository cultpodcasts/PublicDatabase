      "title": "Ep 123: From Cult to Reconnecting and Deeply Trusting Yourself with Demetra Gray",
      "description": "In this episode, I\u2019m joined by Demetra Gray, a wife, writer, and podcast host as she shares the complete shift she\u2019s experienced in her life over the past year and a half, as she realized she was in a spiritual cult and left the cult.  How Demetra realized the community she was in was a cult.  The manipulation Demetra felt every time she got close to her next monetary goal.  What a spiritual cult is.  Quantum, ascension, energy, and codes. There\u0027s truth in everything, but it can be a detriment to others when it\u2019s taken too far.\u00A0  The spiritual connection back to Earth and nature.  Trusting the feminine and your own body.  The dangers of nervous system disassociation.  The power of faith and trusting in a higher power.  All the layers of us that are at play, beyond just the spiritual realm.\u00A0  How the spiritual worlds teach us to question everything.  How Lisa\u0027s nervous breakdown and experiencing the fires of hell brought her to trust God. The filtering of New Age teachings.  Demetra\u2019s food and hormone journey.   What made Demetra leave the cult.  Healing through speaking of her experiences, trauma, and growth.  The trend of cults in the coaching world.  The importance of deeply trusting yourself.  What Demetra\u2019s work looks like now.  The #1 thing that contributes to a great marriage.   Guest Bio: Demetra Gray is a writer who lives with her husband, Jordan, on a little island off the West coast of British Columbia.
