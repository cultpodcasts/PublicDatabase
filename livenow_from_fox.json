James Comer, a letter confirming they\u2019re challenging the legality of the subpoenas, and the two also sent a personal letter to Comer and shared it on social media.\n\nThe Clintons\u2019 attorney sent a letter to Comey arguing the subpoenas are invalid and legally unenforceable because they seek testimony with no connection to a valid legislative purpose, are intended to harass and embarrass, and potentially run afoul of the separation of powers doctrine. \n\nThe Clintons also sent Comer a personal letter and released it on social media.\n\n\u0022We have tried to give you the little information we have.
