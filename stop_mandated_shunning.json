In a shocking move, Watch Tower\u2019s lawyers labelled the victims \u201Chostile.\u201D \n\nThe case is looking bad for the JW organization, but some believe they plan to lose so they can escalate it to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) for an even bigger legal battle. Will this be the beginning of real accountability for Watch Tower\u2019s shunning policy?",
