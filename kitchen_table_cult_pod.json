With Devout, Anna unpacks what worked and didn\u0027t work for her in her struggle to keep her faith in tact and get adequate treatment for the way her brain works. We discuss tolerating joy, therapy, ketamine treatments, and purity culture, as well as what supporting someone you love with mental health struggles can entail.
