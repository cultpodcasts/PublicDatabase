What I saw was unsettling:\n\nFamilies and children wearing strange, outdated clothing\n\nBlind obedience enforced by strict, abusive control\n\nA way of life stripped of joy, individuality, and freedom\n\n\nIt didn\u2019t feel like a religious group \u2014 it felt like a controlled, isolated nightmare.\n\nI also visited their former location, now abandoned but still haunted by the energy of what happened there.\n\n\n---\n\nPacaya Volcano\nEarlier in the trip, I hiked the Pacaya Volcano, where smoke still rises from the cracked earth \u2014 raw, powerful, and unforgettable.\n\n\n---\n\nAntigua\u2019s Chabad \u0026 the \u201CHand in the Mountain\u201D\nIn total contrast, I stopped at the beautiful and uplifting Chabad of Antigua, a place full of kindness and light.\nI also visited the famous \u201Chand in the mountain\u201D \u2014 a surreal and peaceful landmark tucked into the hills.\n\n\n--\n\nConsider checking out my other video, my conversations with one of the members of the cult,\n\n\n\n--\nSponsored By:\n\nCard Right App\nby Help Me Build Credit\nhttps://cardright.com/?ref=27cd56fe7f4350e3\n\nMedease Home Care\nRevolutionary care straight to your couch.\nhttps://medease.info/LG\n\nLET\u2019S SHOW\nwill get your business exhibition booth\ndone\u2014from design to setup!\nPhone: 646-713-4583\nWhatsApp: https://wa.me/16467134583\nEmail: hello@letsshow.nyc\nhttps://letsshow.nyc\n\n--\n\n00:00 Intro\n01:00 Way to Guatemala \n02:04 Kehiles Ohr Chudosh\n06:14 Sleepover In Antigua\n11:24 Chabad of Antigua \n18:21 Tuk-Tuk ride in Antigua\n19:52 Pacaya Volcano Hike\n27:40 Chabad of Antigua \n30:37 Lev Tahor Cult \n35:58 Lev Tahor\u0027s previous facility\n39:45 Delivering Food for the children in the shelters\n41:24 Sleepover in Antigua \n42:59 La Mano Gigante Hobbitenango\n45:43 Way Home",
