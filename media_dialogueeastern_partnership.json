      "description": "Katetyna Sokolova comes from Luhansk, Ukraine. In 2014, Russia occupied her native city. Her father was subjected to Russian propaganda. He was severely brainwashed. On the first day of the full-scale Russian-Ukrainian war he wished death to her. She stopped communicating with him in May 2022. He is not interested if she is still alive. She was the closest family member and yet became the worst enemy because of the Totalitarian Cult of Putin. This video is a brief introduction to the topic of brainwashing and actions to take to deprogram former cult members or to stop brainwashing at the first stage.",
