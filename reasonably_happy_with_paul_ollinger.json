      "description": "In this thought-provoking episode of Reasonably Happy, Paul Ollinger sits down with journalist and author Jane Borden to unpack her explosive new book Cults Like Us: Why Doomsday Thinking Drives America. Together, they explore how apocalyptic beliefs, religious extremism, and cult-like behaviors have shaped American identity\u2014from Puritan roots to modern political movements like MAGA. Jane reveals how tribal psychology, anti-intellectualism, and the prosperity gospel fuel division, and why both the far right and far left are vulnerable to cultish thinking. With dark humor, candid insights, and a deep dive into American history, this episode is a must-watch for anyone curious about religion, politics, and the future of democracy.
