But today\u2019s brave guest, Summer Smith, shares what happens when the world of pli\u00E9s and pirouettes meets dogmatic devotion. Raised in a strict religious family and molded by the intense world of competitive ballet, Summer\u0027s journey takes a surprising twist when she joins Ballet 58, a seemingly innocuous Christian ballet company in Chicago. Soon devotions blend with dance routines, and artistic discipline intertwines with cult-like control. As Summer navigates the thin line between dedication and manipulation, you\u0027ll be left questioning just how far the influence of a charismatic leader can reach.

This is a story of incredible resilience, bravery, and inspiration. Being born into a cult always comes with its challenges, but learning how to have an original thought in your mid-20s is a rare struggle that most people are fortunate enough to never have to face. This is just one of many obstacles Angel had to overcome as she ventured out of the cult and into the world. But when you\u0027ve spent over 20 years of your life in a cult and it\u0027s all you know, the real world isn\u0027t always as sparkly as you hoped.

But for others, the non-affiliation creates a dangerous pathway to a choose your own adventure \u0022religion.\u0022 For Shannon Payton, it was an adventure all right, but not one she necessarily would\u0027ve chosen...if, of course, given the choice. Shannon has lived more of her life inside the cult than out, but this social media comedian is just starting to scratch the surface of having her voice heard.
