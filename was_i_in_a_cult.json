      "description": "So\u2026 remember that acting class? Well, turns out this \u201Chuman behavior expert\u201D has her eyes on a much larger prize. I mean, you can\u2019t be the next Tony Robbins while just teaching scene analysis. In Part 2 of Liz\u2019s story, Sandy\u2019s world shifts into trying to become what it\u2019s been after all along: a spiritual self-help empire. Except this one is built on word salad, public humiliation, and the slow, steady squeeze of control. (Spoiler: Her goal never \u0022manifested\u0022) In this shift, the class expands beyond Los Angeles\u2026 all the way across the world to India. Because when you\u2019re in a class to learn scene analysis, the obvious next step is a spiritual retreat. The language changes. The pressure shifts. And suddenly, \u201Ctransformation\u201D comes with a hefty price tag. A world where boundary crossing is reframed as growth and the cost of admission is total and complete loyalty. And if you can\u2019t afford it? No worries. Just sell your car. One student did. And if you learn nothing else - as Liz would tell you, when someone slaps you in India, kick \u2019em in the cooch. _______ FOLLOW US For more culty content - follow us on Instagram \u0026 TikTok \u2192 @wasiinacult SUPPORT THE SHOW If you believe in what we\u2019re doing - shining a light on manipulation, coercive control, and cultic abuse - please rate, review, and share the podcast.

The media obsessed. The artists sang. And David Berg, an apocalyptic sex cult leader, saw confirmation that judgment was imminent. Christmas would be the end.\n\nIn this episode, we trace how the Children of God turned a celestial event into\u00A0The Christmas Monster, sending families fleeing the United States, scattering members across the globe, and quietly erasing the idea of home altogether.\n\nWe speak with Perry Bulwar, who was recruited into the cult as a teenager and lived inside it for over twenty years.

      "description": "When we got the email inviting us to interview journalist Natalie Robehmed about her new CBC \u0026#43; Campsite Media podcast, Allison After NXIVM, we weren\u2019t sure what to do. Talking about Allison Mack \u2014 someone who caused very real harm, including to people we\u2019ve had on this show - is complicated. And honestly? We didn\u2019t want to accidentally platform or sanitize that harm. But then we listened. And what we found wasn\u2019t a redemption story. It was complexity. It was discomfort. It was a journalist tracing how someone can be both a victim and a perpetrator. In this conversation, Natalie takes us behind her interviews with Allison: childhood exploitation, Hollywood pressures, the hunger to be \u201Cthe best,\u201D and the dynamics of NXIVM\u2019s inner circle that turned all of that into something horrifying. We\u2019re not here to tell you how to feel about Allison Mack. But we are here to sit in the space where victimhood and violence blur - the space where a person realizes the monster they were running from is the one they learned to be.

She survived the blood atonement doctrine that stalked her childhood like a shadow. But this is the part of Pamela Jones\u2019s story where she does the impossible: she runs. In this final chapter of our three-part series, Pamela plans an escape nearly as dangerous as the life she\u2019s leaving behind\u2014nine children in tow, no legal paperwork for half of them, almost no money, and the very real fear that leaving could mean death. This episode isn\u2019t just about leaving a cult. It\u2019s about rebuilding an identity from scratch. It\u2019s about motherhood as revolution. It\u2019s about reclaiming a life she was told she never owned. And it\u2019s the story of what Pamela built on the other side\u2014freedom, love, a business, and a legacy that\u2019s inspiring other women to walk out of the same darkness she escaped. Her transformation is staggering. Her resilience is unforgettable. Her ending is exactly what she deserved. Pamela\u2019s memoir, The Dirt Beneath Our Door, is linked in the show notes. _____________ FOLLOW US For more culty content \u2014 follow us on Instagram \u0026 TikTok \u2192 @wasiinacult SUPPORT THE SHOW If you believe in what we\u2019re doing (and want to help us keep shining light on the dark corners of control and charisma), please rate, review, and share the podcast.

That little film? Sons of Perdition premiered at Tribeca. And one of the mothers at the heart of that story? Jorjina Broadbent.

You\u2019ve seen them \u2014 maybe at the airport with pamphlets, or quietly shopping at a farmer\u2019s market. Dressed in starched shirts, tie-back bonnets, pressed skirts. Singing in gentle harmonies. Smiling softly. The Holdeman Mennonites, they\u2019ll tell you, are just humble people of faith. Quiet. Nonviolent. Pure. But purity can be a costume. And obedience, a weapon. Today\u2019s guest, Billy Holdeman-Bass grew up in that world. And there were things that didn\u2019t get sung about. Doors that stayed locked. And a question his mother never answered: \u201CWhy do you always follow me to the bathroom?\u201D Behind the hymnals and homemade apple pies lies a truth that can\u2019t stay buried forever. In this episode, that truth begins to speak. ________ Follow Us for More Culty Content: Instagram \u0026 TikTok: @wasiinacult Follow Billy\u2019s parody account: @holdememes Support the Show: This show is listener-powered.

After his suicide, his wife\u2014his most devoted follower\u2014carried out an unspeakable murder-suicide that took the lives of their children.\n\nAll but one.\n\nTheir daughter Rachel survived\u2014and in many ways, because she did, so did the cult.

A man claiming to be God became the catalyst for a tragedy that left a city shaken and a family shattered. Emmanuel David\u2014born Charles Bruce Longo\u2014founded a small but insidious cult rooted in offshoot Mormon beliefs, prophetic delusions, and total control. Despite the mass suicide\u2014or murder-suicide, depending on who you ask\u2014the cult didn\u2019t die with its leader. The remaining believers held on. They kept the doctrine alive. And for decades, they waited for their God to return. Today\u2019s guest is one of the few who remained.

Growing up in South Central LA, Vida\u0027s father found salvation in a Pentecostal church led by a self-proclaimed prophet. For Vida, the church was initially a comforting community, offering structure and belonging. But over time, it became clear that what she knew as normal was deeply damaging: fasting replaced freedom, demons blamed for everyday struggles, and poverty persisted despite relentless donations. Vida shares her journey from unquestioning devotion to courageous self-discovery, ultimately reclaiming her life from the tangled legacy of faith, trauma, and generational pain.

But Crystal had other plans. This is the ultimate rags-to-riches story. She didn\u2019t just escape the cult\u2014she obliterated every expectation it had for her. From eating half-eaten Snickers bars out of the trash to becoming a wildly successful entrepreneur, from being promised to a 30-year-old man at 15 to discovering (in the most hilariously ways possible) that she really enjoys sex\u2014Crystal\u2019s life is nothing short of jaw-dropping. At times hilarious, at others absolutely heart-wrenching, Crystal shares with raw honesty how indoctrination shapes identity, how control distorts self-worth, and how breaking free comes at a cost. But she also proves that no matter how deep the conditioning, you can defy every expectation, reclaim your power, and build a life beyond your wildest dreams. __________________ Follow us for more culty content: @wasiinacult Have your own story about high-control groups, or breaking free from an oppressive system?

      "description": "There was no commune. No matching robes or group chants. A charismatic leader? Yes. But no room full of followers. This is a story about a cult of one \u2014 a lesser-known, yet perhaps more common, type of cult. When Alex first met her college advisor, she thought she\u2019d found a mentor\u2014someone brilliant, charismatic, and seemingly invested in her success. But behind the charm lay something much darker. Slowly, methodically, he pushed boundaries under the guise of guidance and concern\u2014first emotionally, then physically\u2014until she was isolated from friends and family, no longer trusting her own judgment. In today\u2019s episode, we explore how one-on-one cults operate using the same tactics as larger cults\u2014love-bombing, coercion, and manipulation\u2014but in the intimate, hidden space between just two people. This is a chilling tale of how a trusted authority figure became a master manipulator, pulling the strings until Alex\u2019s world was no longer her own. It\u2019s a stark reminder that sometimes the most dangerous cult leader isn\u2019t the one standing on a stage\u2014but the one sitting across from you, offering a warm smile and a seemingly harmless invitation to talk. _____ Follow us for more culty content: @wasiinacult Got a story about manipulation, power dynamics, or your own cult of one?

      "description": "CONTENT WARNING: This episode discusses sensitive and potentially triggering topics around sex and sexual dynamics. Amelia returns to share the conclusion of her story, exposing the hidden dangers she encountered within the BDSM kink scene in the UK. While this subculture promised sexual liberation and empowerment, Amelia reveals how it often justified harmful dynamics and enabled exploitation. In this episode, Amelia reveals the unsettling realities of concepts like \u2018dark age play\u2019 and \u2018consensual non-consent,\u2019 where blurred boundaries and the guise of consent are used to excuse abuse and shield predators from accountability. Her candid account delves into the manipulation, cult-like groupthink, and the profound psychological toll of her more than 10-years immersed in the scene. Through her story, Amelia highlights the importance of questioning systems that silence dissent, the slippery slope of power dynamics, and the courage it takes to finally shut the door for good on an environment that no longer reflects your values. Amelia\u0027s journey serves as a reminder that true empowerment comes from recognizing harm, standing against exploitation, and reclaiming your voice\u2014even when it means walking away from the spaces you once called home. ____ Control Body Odor ANYWHERE with @lumedeodorant and get 15% off with promo code \u201CINACULT\u201D at LumeDeodorant.com! ____ Resist aging at the cellular level, try Qualia Senolytic.

Falun Gong, a Chinese spiritual movement-slash-religion-slash-cult, known for its Shen Yun dancers and its ties to \u0027The Epoch Times\u2019 entangled her family in its facade of meditation and enlightenment. In this two-part episode, Angela recounts her experience in a world where karma is not just a bitch, but a force that can dictate life and death\u2026 with suffering seen as path to salvation and modern medicine demonized as an obstacle to spiritual purity.

Soon she was recruited into more than just the sweat and before she knew it, she was in the inner circle.

This is a story of incredible resilience, bravery, and inspiration. Being born into a cult always comes with its challenges, but learning how to have an original thought in your mid-20s is a rare struggle that most people are fortunate enough to never have to face. This is just one of many obstacles Angel had to overcome as she ventured out of the cult and into the world. But when you\u0027ve spent over 20 years of your life in a cult and it\u0027s all you know, the real world isn\u0027t always as sparkly as you hoped.

But for others, the non-affiliation creates a dangerous pathway to a choose your own adventure \u0022religion.\u0022 For Shannon Payton, it was an adventure all right, but not one she necessarily would\u0027ve chosen...if, of course, given the choice. Shannon has lived more of her life inside the cult than out, but this social media comedian is just starting to scratch the surface of having her voice heard. A voice, of course, that wasn\u0027t allowed to be heard for most of her life. And trust us, it\u0027s a voice worth hearing. Shannon now has her own podcast called: The Shanny Pants Show podcast.
