At its heart stood the church, looming over daily life. But what looked like small-town order was really something far darker. Built in the aftermath of World War II, by leaders with lingering Nazi ties, the town was engineered for control: walls without walls, designed to keep its people in and the rest of the world out. Years later, in a casual conversation with a sibling, the truth unraveled: This wasn\u2019t just a devout community. It was a cult. COME SEE US LIVE!!!

But for Jorjina, something inside her starts to shift.

That little film? Sons of Perdition premiered at Tribeca. And one of the mothers at the heart of that story? Jorjina Broadbent. This week, Jorjina, mother of twelve (yes, twelve), former sister-wife - joins us to recount what life was really like inside the FLDS: arranged marriage, relentless obedience, magical underwear, and raising a family in a trailer where babies sometimes had to sleep in drawers. And the escape is hair raising. And Tyler was there to capture it.

A man claiming to be God became the catalyst for a tragedy that left a city shaken and a family shattered. Emmanuel David\u2014born Charles Bruce Longo\u2014founded a small but insidious cult rooted in offshoot Mormon beliefs, prophetic delusions, and total control. Despite the mass suicide\u2014or murder-suicide, depending on who you ask\u2014the cult didn\u2019t die with its leader. The remaining believers held on. They kept the doctrine alive. And for decades, they waited for their God to return. Today\u2019s guest is one of the few who remained.

In college, she joined a company that promised purpose, leadership, and a paycheck. Instead, she got cold showers, commission-only \u201Ctraining,\u201D and a summer knocking on strangers\u0027 doors\u2026 while carrying 40 pounds of encyclopedias.\n\n\n\n\nBut plot twist: just when she thought she\u2019d moved on, community came calling again. This time through a church weight loss group, \u2026where Diet Mountain Dew became her spiritual practice, and hunger was a sign of holiness.\n\n\n\n\nFunny, sharp, and disarmingly honest, Aydrea shares what it\u2019s like to look back and realize oh, cool cool\u2026 I joined TWO cults. And maybe more importantly, how the craving for belonging can sneak us into places we never meant to be.\n\n\n\n\nLINKS:\n\n\n\n\nLIVE SHOW!

Growing up in South Central LA, Vida\u0027s father found salvation in a Pentecostal church led by a self-proclaimed prophet. For Vida, the church was initially a comforting community, offering structure and belonging. But over time, it became clear that what she knew as normal was deeply damaging: fasting replaced freedom, demons blamed for everyday struggles, and poverty persisted despite relentless donations. Vida shares her journey from unquestioning devotion to courageous self-discovery, ultimately reclaiming her life from the tangled legacy of faith, trauma, and generational pain. Thank you, Vida, for your courage, your honesty, and your wisdom\u2014and yes, for challenging Tyler\u0027s musical tastes. _______ **Follow us for more culty content: @wasiinacult **Support us: If \u0027Was I in a Cult?\u0027 has impacted you, please rate and review us\u2014it truly makes a difference!

But Crystal had other plans. This is the ultimate rags-to-riches story. She didn\u2019t just escape the cult\u2014she obliterated every expectation it had for her. From eating half-eaten Snickers bars out of the trash to becoming a wildly successful entrepreneur, from being promised to a 30-year-old man at 15 to discovering (in the most hilariously ways possible) that she really enjoys sex\u2014Crystal\u2019s life is nothing short of jaw-dropping. At times hilarious, at others absolutely heart-wrenching, Crystal shares with raw honesty how indoctrination shapes identity, how control distorts self-worth, and how breaking free comes at a cost. But she also proves that no matter how deep the conditioning, you can defy every expectation, reclaim your power, and build a life beyond your wildest dreams. __________________ Follow us for more culty content: @wasiinacult Have your own story about high-control groups, or breaking free from an oppressive system?

      "description": "There was no commune. No matching robes or group chants. A charismatic leader? Yes. But no room full of followers. This is a story about a cult of one \u2014 a lesser-known, yet perhaps more common, type of cult. When Alex first met her college advisor, she thought she\u2019d found a mentor\u2014someone brilliant, charismatic, and seemingly invested in her success. But behind the charm lay something much darker. Slowly, methodically, he pushed boundaries under the guise of guidance and concern\u2014first emotionally, then physically\u2014until she was isolated from friends and family, no longer trusting her own judgment. In today\u2019s episode, we explore how one-on-one cults operate using the same tactics as larger cults\u2014love-bombing, coercion, and manipulation\u2014but in the intimate, hidden space between just two people. This is a chilling tale of how a trusted authority figure became a master manipulator, pulling the strings until Alex\u2019s world was no longer her own. It\u2019s a stark reminder that sometimes the most dangerous cult leader isn\u2019t the one standing on a stage\u2014but the one sitting across from you, offering a warm smile and a seemingly harmless invitation to talk. _____ Follow us for more culty content: @wasiinacult Got a story about manipulation, power dynamics, or your own cult of one?

      "description": "In the gripping conclusion to Jeanne Nolan\u0027s story, the idyllic facade of Zendik Farm finally shatters. Beneath its promises of revolution and a self-sustaining community lies a darker reality: broken families and devastating power plays. Jeanne recounts her heart-wrenching separation from her baby, the unraveling of relationships under the commune\u2019s twisted rules, and her ultimate escape after 17 long years. Through painful truths and a hard-won sense of clarity, Jeanne forges a new life outside the cult, turning trauma into a legacy of love, family, and a thriving organic gardening business that inspires others to embrace sustainability, growth, and connection\u2026 and all in a very healthy and not-at-all culty way of course. This is a story of resilience, transformation, and the extraordinary ability to cultivate beauty from even the darkest of places.\n\n_____\n\nBuy Jeanne\u2019s book here!!\u00A0\n\nJeanne\u2019s incredible business \u201CThe Organic Gardener\u201D https://www.theorganicgardener.net/\u00A0\n\nAnd if you want more Zendik, read Helen Zuman\u2019s memoir, \u201CMating in Captivity\u201D\n\n_____\n\nStop Scooping!

      "description": "CONTENT WARNING: This episode discusses sensitive and potentially triggering topics around sex and sexual dynamics. Amelia returns to share the conclusion of her story, exposing the hidden dangers she encountered within the BDSM kink scene in the UK. While this subculture promised sexual liberation and empowerment, Amelia reveals how it often justified harmful dynamics and enabled exploitation. In this episode, Amelia reveals the unsettling realities of concepts like \u2018dark age play\u2019 and \u2018consensual non-consent,\u2019 where blurred boundaries and the guise of consent are used to excuse abuse and shield predators from accountability. Her candid account delves into the manipulation, cult-like groupthink, and the profound psychological toll of her more than 10-years immersed in the scene. Through her story, Amelia highlights the importance of questioning systems that silence dissent, the slippery slope of power dynamics, and the courage it takes to finally shut the door for good on an environment that no longer reflects your values. Amelia\u0027s journey serves as a reminder that true empowerment comes from recognizing harm, standing against exploitation, and reclaiming your voice\u2014even when it means walking away from the spaces you once called home. ____ Control Body Odor ANYWHERE with @lumedeodorant and get 15% off with promo code \u201CINACULT\u201D at LumeDeodorant.com! ____ Resist aging at the cellular level, try Qualia Senolytic.

Drew grew up under the domineering influence of his father, \u201CDollar Bill\u201D Matthews, a pastor whose self-interest knew no bounds. From childhood indoctrination to traumatic \u0022exorcisms\u0022 and endless demands for loyalty, Drew was constantly searching for the love and acceptance his father never offered. This episode unravels a tale of betrayal on every level\u2014Drew\u2019s own father not only controlled his life but ultimately orchestrated the unthinkable: the estrangement of Drew\u2019s wife and daughter.

But today she shares the truth about what was going on behind closed doors: the isolation, the loss of self, the abuse, the control, the manipulation and the gaslighting that kept her in a haze of confusion and pain. But, like every guest on this show, she shares the moment she finally found the strength and courage to walk away for good.\u00A0\n\nNow a respected therapist, Dr. Nae emphasizes the importance of therapy in her healing process and destigmatizing the experiences of victims of cult leaders or pathological lovers.

But for others, the non-affiliation creates a dangerous pathway to a choose your own adventure \u0022religion.\u0022 For Shannon Payton, it was an adventure all right, but not one she necessarily would\u0027ve chosen...if, of course, given the choice. Shannon has lived more of her life inside the cult than out, but this social media comedian is just starting to scratch the surface of having her voice heard. A voice, of course, that wasn\u0027t allowed to be heard for most of her life. And trust us, it\u0027s a voice worth hearing. Shannon now has her own podcast called: The Shanny Pants Show podcast.
