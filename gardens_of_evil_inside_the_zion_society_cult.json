      "description": "It was just another quiet neighborhood in small town America. At least, that\u0027s how it looked. But the immaculately groomed yards, trimmed hedges, and brightly colored flower gardens hid an insidious secret. More than a hundred residents were members of a cult called The Zion Society. Hiding in plain sight, they hoarded guns and ammunition. They created, sold, and modeled sexy lingerie. They took children away from parents and groomed them for sexual abuse. Their beliefs were centered around satisfying the perverted desires of one man - their leader: an unassuming, soft-spoken retiree. Neighbors knew something was amiss, but it wasn\u0027t until a brave young woman broke away from the secretive group and confessed to authorities that everything began to unravel for this dangerous cult. This is the story of that unraveling told by the people who lived it.
