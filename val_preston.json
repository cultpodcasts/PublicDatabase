      "title": "Jim Jones welcoming new Jonestown members (April 2 1978)",
      "description": "Jim Jones leads a meeting of the Jonestown community, and many elements of such meetings \u2013 references to specific items in the news, conjecture of the coming economic collapse of the U.S. and/or nuclear war, reminders both of the miracles which Jones performs to save people\u2019s lives and the health care that residents receive on a daily basis \u2013 are present. The main difference between this and many other Jonestown tapes is that this was recorded on a night that a number of new people had arrived. In the course of this meeting, then, Jones talks about the benefits of living in Jonestown, even as he acknowledges some of the hardships and temporary inconveniences they have to endure. He and other leaders review some of the rules which govern the community. Newcomers also witness what happens when people break the rules: there are several reviews of the misbehavior of some Temple members already in Guyana, and Jones decides on several penalties, ranging from placing miscreants onto the Learning Crew, to requiring a woman to let a large snake crawl over her. \u201CDon\u2019t expect to come over here and find Hollywood,\u201D Jones says as the tape opens. There are problems in Jonestown. Living conditions are more crowded than what they want, family housing has not yet been constructed \u2013 although couples can live together \u2013 and people are working harder than he intended them to. Both the CIA and Social Security have blocked their money, there are essential supplies needlessly \u2013 and sinisterly \u2013 being held up at the docks in Georgetown, and the Federal Communications Commission is giving them trouble about their radio transmissions. But still, Jones adds, the community provides what\u2019s necessary for its survival. The people just have to decide what\u2019s more important, if \u201Cyou have your little creature comforts, or is it really important that your children are taken care of in their hour of need?\u201D A moment later, he points out that most of the people who come, especially the blacks and poor whites, are grateful to be there. Addressing the people who do complain, Jones says, \u201CThe only reason you got problems is \u2019cause you give yourself time for problems.\u201D The theme returns through the two-hour tape: \u201CCuba was surrounded for ten years, we got no reason to complain,\u201D Jones says later in referring to the their proceedings as a \u201Ctrouble night meeting\u201D; \u201CYou realize you have no reason to complain when two out of three babies are going to bed hungry,\u201D Jones says about halfway through. It isn\u2019t that they don\u2019t allow dissent within Jonestown, he adds at one point. But \u201C[y]ou got to be awful careful about dissent. Dissent better be over something mighty crucial, mighty crucial.\u201D He makes another less direct mention of dissent later, when he says how important it is for the people to stand up to their enemies in the U.S. by staying in Jonestown \u2013 thereby denying them a chance to disgrace and kill them \u2013 and that Jonestown will survive only if they stand in solidarity. \u201CSo we demand that. Solidarity, cohesiveness, unity, and no talking behind anyone\u2019s back. You got any improvements, constructive suggestions, we welcome it. Any ideas on how to make this a better place, we welcome it, but we don\u2019t want any back talk.\u201D The conversation also turns \u2013 and also returns several times \u2013 to the conspiracy against Jonestown. The forces that have aligned against them, both government and relatives, require the community to be more restrictive than it will be in the future. While there are some people coming and going, in general, Jones doesn\u2019t want anybody to leave until everyone from the U.S. is down there. The problem is, people who leave are subject to kidnapping. Worse, some of them \u2013 he mentions Tim Stoen and Yolanda Williams by name \u2013 turn into traitors themselves and start working against the things they once believed in. Jones reminds them of what the conspiracy has done \u2013 laid seige to the community for six days, fired shots from the jungle \u2013 even as he recalls the protection they all have, including from the beasts of the jungle surrounding them, as long as they stay within the encampment. \u201CWe\u2019re in a war,\u201D Jones says several times, and their enemies are not just those who attack their community. He criticizes the capitalist system, the military that would produce a weapon as insidious as a neutron bomb, the \u201Cright wing\u201D that wants to have a nuclear war, and an intelligence system that is so out of control, even the president is not above investigation. He brings that back to the importance of adapting to the hardships of Jonestown. \u201C[W]hen you stop to think of the murderous shit that\u2019s being done by United States,\u201D he says, \u201Cyou\u2019ll adjust.\u201D As with other subjects in the meeting, the theme of neceessary adjustments recurs several times.",

      "description": "42:20\nJim Jones - People\u0027s Temple LA service \n\nThis Peoples Temple service from 1973 in Los Angeles consists of two parts. In the first half of the tape, numerous members of the Temple come forward to testify about the miracles performed by Jim Jones. The Temple leader himself does not appear until the second half of the taper, during which he talks about the gifts he provides to the faithful, including healings. He demonstrates that by curing an elderly woman both of her lameness and of a cancer on her bladder. The theme that unites the two halves of the tape is a call for additional funds for the Temple to do its work. Numerous people testify to the powers of Jim Jones during the first half of the tape, and while most involve faith healings \u2013 including raising people from the dead \u2013 not all are. One woman recounts how her son was in a prison camp in Korea, and that when she told Jim Jones, \u201Che asked me not to worry about it. And I didn\u2019t, \u2018cause I believe him.\u201D Two months later, the word came that her son had been freed, and soon after that \u2013 despite official pronouncements of much longer delays \u2013 he returned to the US and was reunited with his family. There are indications that Jones has replaced God as the deity for many of his followers. The unidentified man who acts as the emcee during the first half of the tape attributes a family\u2019s escape from a fire to \u201CFather\u2019s voice\u201D that had awakened the mother, and quotes her as saying, \u201CNone of my children were even singed by the fire or harmed by the smoke\u2026 Father is the one and only God there is, and no one can take that away from me.\u201D One woman concludes her testimony by singing the hymn, \u201COur God Is Real,\u201D although she has altered the lyrics to \u201CJim Jones Is Real.\u201D \u201CI\u2019ll change the words to that,\u201D she explains before she sings. The devotion is complete for several speakers. Brother Crane, a man who appears on several other tapes besides this one, concludes his testimony about several miracles at the hands of Jim Jones by saying, \u201CI have decided, that live or die, sink or swim, I\u2019m gonna follow him. Wherever he leads, that\u2019s the way I\u2019m going.\u201D While Brother Crane did not go to Guyana, his sentiments capture what many Temple parishioners felt. Jones pursues similar themes when he appears in the pulpit. Even while reminding his followers of the diseases and conditions he\u2019s cured and the lives he\u2019s saved, he devotes the most time talking about the miracle of a woman who had committed a number of crimes and whom Temple leaders \u2013 including Jones \u2013 had urged to turn herself in. The police were so amazed that the woman did so \u2013 \u201Cshe said, they\u2019ve taught me what\u2019s right, and I\u2019m going\u201D \u2013 that they released her within hours. \u201CThey arrested her at three o\u2019clock this morning, and they turned her loose and said go back to the church at four\u2026 they praised the church and praised this action and let her go.\u201D The only healing he performs on tape is of a woman whose conditions are both physical and medical. He prepares her for the healing, as he does on almost every occasion, by revealing details of her life that only someone with paranormal powers would know, although he does reprove her gently when she begins to agree too readily with what he tells her. \u201CListen to me now,\u201D he says halfway through his revelation. \u201CYou\u2019re all carried away.\u201D A few minutes later, when she responds to his call for her faith in him with a mantra of \u201CThank you, Jesus,\u201D he reprimands her with some irritability. \u201CThank whoever you wish,\u201D he says sharply. \u201CIf you wish to thank Jesus, as long as you don\u2019t have a segregationist Jesus\u2026 you have to know what kind of Jesus you\u2019re following. Because there\u2019re many Jesuses.\u201D The exchange is still on his mind as the healing for her lameness takes effect. \u201CNow, in the name of God, socialism, stand up!\u201D he cries, \u201C\u2026[I]n the name of the greatest name on earth \u2013 socialism \u2013 \u2026in the name of that which I am. In my name, God, socialism, on your feet!\u201D The emcee in the first half has already made a pitch for additional financial support. \u201CEveryone wants blessings and protections like that, and miracles like you\u2019ve witnessed here time and time again, every day,\u201D he says as the tape opens. \u201CBut not everyone is willing to do all they can to further God\u2019s work. Giving in tithes and offering is like priming a pump, so that blessings can flow from God to you.\u201D Jones picks up where his disciple left off, but in addition to reminding his people of the benefits of giving, he warns them of the consequences of withholding their share. Three people had left the Temple the night before without making a donation, he says. One was shot soon afterwards, one was stabbed, and the third was saved from a stabbing only because he returned to the Temple and made a gift.",

      "description": "Airing in 1981, the documentary was written by James Reston Jr. and Noah Adams, and produced by Deborah Amos. It was based on the tapes Reston acquired under the Freedom of Information Act, and won major broadcast awards, including the Dupont Columbia Award, the National Headliner Award and the Prix Italia.\n\nFather Cares: The Last of Jonestown recaptures the final months for the People\u0027s Temple cult. After problems arose for the group in San Francisco, they moved to the South American jungle during the 1970s. In 1978, reports of an increasingly hostile and controlling atmosphere by Jones sparked a congressional fact-finding mission, led by Rep. Leo J. Ryan (D-Calif.), into the cult.\n\nAs Ryan and his group were preparing to leave Jonestown after interviewing members, they were ambushed. Ryan, three American journalists and a Peoples Temple defector were killed. A dozen other people were injured. Hours later, Jones and most of the cult members would die.\n\n****\nCopyright Disclaimer under Section 107 of the copyright act 1976, allowance is made for fair use for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarship, and research.
