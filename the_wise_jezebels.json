      "description": "What do you when your church says abuse and mistreatment is okay? And that it\u2019s not only ok, but it\u2019s God\u2019s design. And what if you\u2019ve identified abuse in your relationship but now notice you\u2019ve had the same experience in your church and maybe even what you\u2019ve been taught about God? Is any faith community safe for women? Today\u2019s episode explores church-sanctioned domestic abuse and intimate partner violence. We deconstruct that old saying, \u201CDon\u2019t throw the baby out with the bathwater and find the shades of gray. Popping into Pop Culture covers Naked Attraction and the news about Puff Daddy Combs, and we have lots to say about how to keep your own \u201Cfruit\u201D fresh. Stay fresh, betches!

If this sounds familiar to what\u2019s been going around on social media with mega church pastor Josh Howerton, you\u2019re correct! The Wise Jezebels break down how harmful that messaging is (and yes, we look at it in context at his followers request which, spoiler alert: makes it worse!) and how it creates dynamics in a relationship that are often difficult to come back from.

Is silence actually complicity? Is speaking out performative? Is the requirement to speak out and pick a side just another form of fundamentalism? We then get into Neandrathal DNA and holiday traditions and end with a conversation on getting back into the dating game when you have children.\u00A0 Remember to submit us your questions for our December Non-Consensual, Consensual Advice episode!

Please note that this episode contains sensitive topics and we understand if you need to skip this one! We also talk about how Laura finally got Tia into watching the Golden Bachelor (spoiler alert: one of us really likes it, one of us doesn\u2019t!) and end the podcast with a discussion about Laura\u2019s upcoming book which is available for pre-order currently and releases, worldwide, on October 17, 2023.
