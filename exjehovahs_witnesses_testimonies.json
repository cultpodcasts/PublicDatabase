      "description": "Sociologist James A.

Beckford identified the group\u0027s chief characteristics as historicism (identifying historical events as relating to the outworking of God\u0027s purpose), absolutism (conviction that Jehovah\u0027s Witness leaders dispense absolute truth), activism (capacity to motivate members to perform missionary tasks), rationalism (conviction that Witness doctrines have a rational basis devoid of mystery), authoritarianism (rigid presentation of regulations without the opportunity for criticism) and world indifference (rejection of certain secular requirements and medical treatments).\n\nSociologist Bryan R.
