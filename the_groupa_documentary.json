During this time he was twice admitted to month-long in-patient hospital stays at group-affiliated facilities, forced to cut ties with family and friends, sent to live across the country with fellow group members and encouraged to drop out of high school.\n\nAlso, during this time, Jacob became a rising star in the organization. Serving as a Group leader in St. Louis and Atlanta, helping to recruit new members, establishing a new chapter in the Atlanta suburbs, organizing Group-sponsored events and preparing to become a Group counselor. \n\nAll before he turned eighteen.
