      "description": "Survivors, current members and parents visit this link for help: https://linktr.ee/enthusiasticsobrietyabuse\n\nThe Group is a network of adolescent drug abuse programs created by Bob Meehan and operated by his son-in-law and protege Clint Stonebraker. Ostensibly aimed at helping young people overcome drug addiction, all evidence points to an organization that aims for profits and operates on a cult-like mentality.\n\nThis organization, while claiming to have rescued thousands of teens from the horrors of drug addiction, has been repeatedly accused of using cult-like practices to control its teenage followers and their concerned families. \n\nThe Group is a feature-length documentary that retraces the director\u0027s five year journey through the world of adolescent drug abuse programs. Through interviews with former members, archival photographs and expert witnesses, The Group tells the often personal story of the young people affected by the organization, their struggles with addiction and life after The Group.",
