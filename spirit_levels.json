      "description": "If your life coach is a psychopath, is that necessarily a bad thing? Coaching is marketed to wannabes as a luxury, business-class lifestyle that grants you total freedom and easy money. (And oh yeah, you might have to deal with some clients in crisis, too.) You\u2019ve just got to learn how to hustle, which means paying a whoop-load of cash to other coaches to get \u0027the codes\u0027. Possibly for the rest of your life. This episode, Frank and Jenny revisit their favourite topic, piggybacking off the Netflix UK documentary Psychopath Life Coach. We ask our guest Danielle Ryan \u2013 a former life coach who now makes explainer videos dissecting the scammier side of the industry \u2013 what trends she\u2019s seeing. These range from the escalating industry of coaches coaching coaches, to the \u2018fitness coach to business coach pipeline\u2019, to business coaches rebranding as spiritual coaches. Along the way, Frank and Jenny discuss Matthew McConaughey\u2019s infiltration into coaching, sweat-lodge disaster guy James Arthur Ray, NLP, Landmark and Dale Carnegie. We also get Jenny\u2019s Indonesian language teacher Jamsen on the show, to talk about how life coaches are taking over Bali and his take on whether that\u2019s all bad.
