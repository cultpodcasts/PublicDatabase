      "description": "Koh Phangan is a small island in southeast Thailand known to tourists for its parties and beautiful beaches. The beauty of the locale also lures visitors in search of relaxation and spiritual awakening. Among the island\u2019s most popular schools is Agama, a yoga community led by Swami Vivekananda Saraswati, whose teachings have attracted thousands of students since opening in 2003.\n\nOnly recently have allegations of sexual assault by the Swami come to light, as reported by the Guardian. (Agama and the Swami deny these allegations.) This short documentary is an in-depth look at how the school\u2014led by one charismatic leader\u2014is accused of fostering a culture of abuse and manipulation under the guise of healing and enlightenment. Janja Lalich PhD, a sociologist and specialist in coercive influence, also explains how leaders can assert power in isolated groups.\n\nSend tips and inquiries to Jennifer Perry, jennifer@jezebel.com",

      "title": "Trailer: The Spiritual Guru Accused of Sexual Assault",
      "description": "Agama is the type of spiritual retreat that has, in the shadow of the wellness movement, become increasingly fashionable. Located in Koh Phangan, Thailand, it is a tropical, paradise-like community focused on nurturing mental and physical health, or as Agama\u2019s website puts it, the \u201Csecret spiritual path of true Integral Yoga courses.\u201D\n\nBut some Agama students say that what they found there was the opposite after interacting with Agama\u2019s founder, Swami Vivekananda Saraswati, a Romanian national who is accused of sexual assault of 14 of his students, as reported by the Guardian. (Agama and the Swami deny the allegations.) In December, Jezebel went to Koh Phangan to speak to some of these accusers, and to try and unravel how a place meant for healing could become so toxic for them. Our full documentary will debut next week; in the meantime, watch the trailer above.
