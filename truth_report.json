      "description": "South Africa\u2019s Political Cults Are Crumbling \u2014 And a New Battle Is Coming\n\nThe ANC is in ICU. MK is collapsing under its own weight. The EFF has hit a ceiling. And a new fight is emerging between the DA, the Patriotic Alliance, and the IFP for South Africa\u2019s next chapter.\n\nIn this explosive Truth Report roundtable, Rob Hersov, Renaldo Gouws, Sama Sambit, and Kuhle Maseko unpack the political freefall:\n\u2013 Why MK is a cult built on loyalty, not leadership.\n\u2013 How the ANC\u2019s old guard has become a \u201Cgovernment of dependents.\u201D\n\u2013 Why Gayton McKenzie\u2019s PA could be the next national disruptor.\n\u2013 And why \u201Cmaking capitalism fashionable again\u201D might be South Africa\u2019s only way out.\n\nFrom the rise of federalism to the death of political messiahs, this is one of the boldest Truth Report debates yet.\n\nWatch the full conversation. Leave your prediction in the comments: Who wins South Africa\u2019s final battle \u2014 the DA, the ANC, or something new?\n\n#TruthReport #RobHersov #RonaldoGouws #SouthAfrica #Politics #ANC #DA #EFF #PatrioticAlliance #KZN #HelenZille #GaytonMcKenzie #Capitalism #Elections2026 #SAFuture #Federalism\n\nConnect with us everywhere: https://linktr.ee/TruthReportNews",
