      "title": "Preparations for Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell\u0027s trial at Ada County Courthouse in Boise",
      "description": "It is the case that spanned from Idaho, Arizona, and Hawaii. Lori Vallow gained national attention after her kids, JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan went missing in September of 2019. The disappearance sparked a nationwide search, and with it, a string of investigations. \r\n\r\nIn June 2020, investigators found the remains of JJ and Tylee outside of Rexburg, on the property of Vallow\u0027s fifth, and current, husband, Chad Daybell. \r\n\r\nThe couple is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the deaths of Vallow\u0027s kids, as well as Daybell\u0027s late wife, Tammy Daybell, who died in October of 2019. \r\n\r\nNow, Vallow and Daybell\u2019s trial is scheduled to begin in January at the Ada County Courthouse. \r\n\r\nThe courthouse is preparing for that trial after judge Steven Boyce ruled the trial would be moved from Fremont County in Eastern Idaho to Boise. \r\n\r\nDaybell\u0027s attorney made the original request for a change of venue, arguing that significant media attention would affect the ability to find a fair and unbiased jury in Fremont County. \r\n\r\nAnother part of the reason for that ruling was so the Ada County jurors would not be transported between the two counties for the duration of that anticipated weeks-long trial, as the prosecution had requested. \r\n\r\nHowever, the case is still part of that Fremont County jurisdiction. So the Ada County Courthouse is essentially providing them the space and facilities, as well as local Ada County jurors to try the case. \r\n\r\n\u201CSo at this point, we\u0027re working closely with Judge Boyce and his staff to ensure they have what they need for them to be able to try the case here,\u201D said Steve Hippler, the administrative district judge for the fourth district in Ada County. \r\n\r\nHippler said while the trial is months away, preparations are already underway. \r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u0027s quite a bit of choreography that needs to take place behind the scenes,\u201D Hippler said. \r\n\r\nSome of that choreography includes making sure the courthouse facilities can accommodate judge Boyce and his staff. And of course, working with Judge Boyce and the jury commissioner to make sure a sufficient number of potential jurors are summoned. \r\n\r\n\u201CWhich in a case like this would be, you know, in the hundreds, if not thousands of potential jurors,\u201D Hippler said. \u201CJudge Boyce will need to decide if he wants to do a written questionnaire of jurors and advance and so there\u0027s work that goes into getting that those many thousand people and having them filled them out, and then getting those responses to the judge and to the lawyer so that they can work through those.\u201D \r\n\r\nAda County also has a larger population, which means a larger pool of potential jurors. \r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u0027s also a capital case, so to find folks who have a position on the death penalty, that would preclude them from being on the jury as a matter of law, and sort of kind of weed out people on that basis first, and then it\u0027s a matter of questioning the jurors individually, to find if they can be fair and impartial,\u201D Hippler said. \r\n\r\nJudge Hippler added that because of the media interest in this case, both locally and nationally, they are also figuring out where members of the media will park, including spaces for satellite trucks. The Ada County Courthouse also has enough space for the media to work inside the courthouse. \r\n\r\n\u201CJudge Boyce will work on what he\u0027s going to allow inside the courtroom itself in terms of media access,\u201D Hippler said. \u201CBut we also have to educate our staff about what is and isn\u0027t appropriate.\u201D\r\n\r\nSecurity is another factor that was considered. Security for inside the courthouse, as well as for the judge and the jury.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u0027s a significant undertaking and it will take a lot of manpower of our staff, our trial court administrator does an exceptional job of coordinating all this,\u201D Hippler said. \u201CAnd, you know, the concern is just simply making sure that everybody involved is safe. that\u0027s the chief concern. The defendant, the jurors, the judge, the witnesses, and that impartiality is maintained, to ensure that they\u0027re not exposed to media sources that they shouldn\u0027t be.\u201D \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the actual selection of the jurors, Judge Hippler said that in a case like this all of the potential jurors will not be together at once. They will likely conduct jury selection in batches over time.",

      "title": "Lori Vallow, Chad Daybell to stand trial in January in Boise",
      "description": "The judge in the case of Lori Vallow Daybell, who, along with her husband, Chad Daybell, is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the deaths of Vallow\u0027s children and Daybell\u0027s former wife, Tammy Daybell, granted a motion on Thursday that clears the way for holding Vallow\u0027s and Daybell\u0027s joint trial in January 2023.\r\n\r\nDaybell\u0027s trial was already scheduled to begin January 9, 2023, but Vallow\u0027s trial date was set for October of this year, even though the cases are joined. The reason: Vallow is reserving her right to a speedy trial, while Daybell has waived it. \r\n\r\nUnder Idaho law, unless \u0022good cause to the contrary is shown,\u0022 a person under indictment in a criminal case must be brought to trial within six months of district court arraignment, which, for Vallow, was April 19. The Idaho law and related criminal procedure rules set statutory speedy-trial guarantees that reinforce the guarantee stated in the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\r\n\r\nProsecutors on May 2 filed a motion asking the court to find good cause to continue Vallow\u0027s trial -- postpone it -- and move it to January in order to \u0022prevent improper severance\u0022 of the case involving her and Daybell. In a response to the state\u0027s motion, Vallow\u0027s defense said she understands her lawyers will have more time to prepare for trial, suggesting there are no major objections on the part of the defense.\r\n\r\nIn a May 19 hearing on that motion, Judge Steven Boyce was looking at whether the grounds for a three-month delay in Vallow\u0027s trial meet speedy-trial protection standards under Idaho statutes as well as under constitutional standards found in case law. His written decision granting the motion comes one week after that hearing.\r\n\r\nJudge Boyce applied four factors outlined in Barker v. Wingo, a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision in which the court held that a defendant\u0027s constitutional right to a speedy trial cannot be established by any inflexible rule, but can be determined only on a balancing basis in which the conduct of the prosecution and the defendant are weighed. The factors include the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, whether the defendant is asserting or has waived the right to a speedy trial, and \u0022the prejudice to the defendant\u0022 -- referring to concerns about lengthy, \u0022oppressive\u0022 pretrial incarceration; minimizing anxiety and concern of the accused; and limiting the possibility that the defense will be impaired.\r\n\r\n\u0022In consideration of the complexity of this case and seriousness of the charges Defendant faces... the Court determines that the length of the delay here weighs in favor of granting the State\u0027s motion,\u0022 Boyce wrote.\r\n\r\nPrimarily because Vallow and Daybell are named in one indictment, and the court has ruled they are properly joined for trial, the state asked the judge to allow postponement of Vallow\u0027s trial until January, coinciding with Daybell\u0027s trial date. In his decision, Judge Boyce called the state\u0027s argument \u0022well founded.\u0022\r\n\r\nOther reasons for postponement, Judge Boyce wrote, include the seriousness of the crimes with which they are charged -- prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Also, an \u0022extraordinary volume\u0022 of evidence and other material for discovery has been produced.\r\n\r\n\u0022(Vallow\u0027s) attorneys have expressed their concern in regards to having adequate time to prepare for a trial in October, although they have in no way argued against their client\u0027s assertion of her speedy trial right,\u0022 Boyce wrote.\r\n\r\nJudge Boyce did note that not bringing Vallow to trial until January 2023 rather than October 2022 \u0022does expand Defendant\u0027s pretrial incarceration.\u0022 However, neither Vallow nor her defense team has expressed any anxiety or concern about that.\r\n\r\nFinally, the judge found that postponing Vallow\u0027s trial \u0022will not result in any impairment\u0022 to her defense. Being forced to move Daybell\u0027s trial up to October, three months earlier than scheduled, would impair Daybell\u0027s defense, he determined.\r\n\r\n\u0022The resulting delay if the State\u0027s Motion is granted would afford defense counsel additional time to prepare for trial,\u0022 Boyce wrote.\r\n\r\n\u0022The Court is cognizant that Defendant is in custody, and has been in custody for an extended period of time. While that factor weighs heavily, and undue incarceration before trial must be limited, it does not outweigh the factors favoring findings of good cause,\u0022 Boyce wrote.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell is now scheduled to begin January 9 at the Ada County Courthouse. It has been set for 10 weeks.",

      "description": "FREMONT COUNTY, Idaho \u2014 The judge in the case of Lori Vallow Daybell, who, along with her husband, Chad Daybell, is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the deaths of Vallow\u0027s children and Daybell\u0027s former wife, Tammy Daybell, will soon issue a written decision on whether to officially set Vallow\u0027s and Daybell\u0027s joint trial for the same date, and if that will take place in October of this year or in January 2023.\n\nDaybell\u0027s trial is scheduled to begin January 9, 2023, but Vallow\u0027s is scheduled to begin October 11, 2022. The reason: Vallow is reserving her right to a speedy trial, while Daybell has waived it. Under Idaho law, unless \u0022good cause to the contrary is shown,\u0022 a person under indictment in a criminal case must be brought to trial within six months of district court arraignment, which, for Vallow, was April 19.

In a response to the state\u0027s motion, Vallow\u0027s defense said she understands her lawyers will have more time to prepare for trial, suggesting there are no major objections on the part of the defense.\n\nIn Thursday\u0027s motion hearing, Judge Steven Boyce heard brief statements from prosecutor Tawnya Rawlings; Vallow\u0027s public defender, James Archibald; and Chad Daybell\u0027s defense lawyer, John Prior. The prosecution and defense had also submitted written briefs to the court before the hearing.\n\nRawlings said prosecutors and the defense have a \u0022mountain of evidence to review in this case,\u0022 and that setting Vallow\u0027s and Daybell\u0027s trials for January would lessen the burden on defense counsel as well as on the prosecution. It also would decrease the potential for issues that might be grounds for appeal after the trial, Rawlings said.\n\n\u0022We feel this alone rises to a legal excuse under State v. Clark justifying a brief continuance, particularly in a case of this complexity, with conspiracy charges and a joint co-defendant,\u0022 Rawlings said, referring to an Idaho Supreme Court opinion from 2000 in which the court concluded that \u0022good cause means that there is a substantial reason that rises to the level of a legal excuse for the delay.\u0022 In that case, \u0022court congestion\u0022 was not accepted as a reason for delaying trial, and a misdemeanor battery charge was dismissed.\n\nRawlings also said avoiding improper severance of Chad Daybell\u0027s and Lori Vallow\u0027s cases and ensuring consistent verdicts justified a \u0022brief delay\u0022 in Vallow\u0027s trial beyond the six-month time frame.\n\nArchibald said the defense team continues to talk frequently with Vallow.\n\n\u0022As recently as [Wednesday] she acknowledged that she still has her right to a speedy trial, and she is not going to waive that right,\u0022 Archibald said. \u0022She understands we\u0027re working hard to get caught up and her defense team is spending a lot of time getting caught up since the state\u0027s been involved in this case for over two years, and she\u0027s been in jail for over two years, but her defense team has not.\u0022\n\nUnder an Idaho criminal procedure rule, a defendant is not entitled to a full defense team until the time of arraignment. As of Thursday, one month has passed since Vallow\u0027s arraignment, and her defense team has been fully funded for just the past month.\n\nRawlings said \u0022a number of outstanding issues\u0022 remain ahead of the trial, including DNA testing of evidence that was put off until Daybell\u0027s and Vallow\u0027s cases were joined earlier this year.\n\n\u0022It is just more equitable to continue (trial) until the January date,\u0022 she said.\n\nAfter the prosecution and defense attorneys spoke, with none arguing against setting the trial for January, Judge Boyce said he did not want to make an oral decision on the spot.\n\n\u0022I want to make sure I apply the proper standard of review and properly balance all the factors I\u0027m required to under the existing case law to make sure I reach the best decision I can on this,\u0022 Boyce said, adding that there wouldn\u0027t be a \u0022big delay\u0022 before he issues his written memorandum decision and order.\n\nProsecutors have notified the court that they intend to seek the death penalty against Vallow and Daybell. Their defense teams are in the process of identifying and interviewing witnesses for the trial and the possible sentencing phase, which would take place if the couple is found guilty. The trial will take place in Ada County.\n\nFor more about this case and other Idaho news, go to ktvb.com.",

      "title": "Vallow-Daybell trial: Jury will not be transported from Ada County to eastern Idaho",
      "description": "The judge overseeing the case of Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow, the eastern Idaho couple charged with the murders of Vallow\u0027s children and Daybell\u0027s late wife, has ruled that the trial shall take place in Ada County.\n\nJudge Steven Boyce on Thursday denied a motion in which prosecutors asked him to reconsider an earlier decision to have the trial located in Ada County with a jury comprised of Ada County residents, a decision that came after he ordered a change of venue requested by Daybell\u0027s defense.\n\nProsecutors requested that a jury from Ada County be transported to Fremont County, some 300 miles away from Boise, and sequestered there for the duration of the trial, which is expected to last 10 weeks. The state argued that the cost of transporting the jury would be substantially less than the cost of conducting the trial in Ada County with a jury sequestered in Ada County. As of Thursday, there is no order to have the jury sequestered during the trial. When a jury is sequestered, jurors are isolated from the public -- often in a hotel -- until after the trial is over.\n\nIn his decision, Judge Boyce wrote that \u0022the Court determines that while it may be more economical to transport a jury to Fremont County, that is not a foregone conclusion given the additional possible scenarios related to sequestration.\u0022\n\nBoyce noted estimates on the trial cost presented by the prosecution, based on different scenarios: more than $379,000 for a sequestered jury in Ada County, about $72,000 for a non-sequestered jury in Ada County, nearly $188,000 for a non-sequestered jury transported to Fremont County, and $187,840 plus additional supervision costs for a jury sequestered in Fremont County. Both the most expensive and least expensive scenarios are those in which the trial is conducted in Ada County.\n\nBoyce also noted that many jurors raise concerns of hardships a lengthy trial would incur, such as not being able to spend time with their families, go to their jobs, or fulfill other daily obligations.\n\n\u0022Finding jurors that are able to serve for 10 straight weeks away from home will likely result in significant number of the fair cross section of the community being excluded from service. The Court is concerned that this may result in jury that does not represent fair cross section of the community, which would run in contravention to the Defendants\u2019 paramount due process right to fair trial,\u0022 Boyce writes. \u0022On the other hand, if sequestration is not required and the jury is free to return home each day with admonishing instructions, the likelihood of securing jury representing fair cross section of the community is greatly increased. That scenario can only take place if the jury is not sequestered or isolated from their lives for an extensive time...\u0022\n\nProsecutors are seeking the death penalty against Daybell and Vallow. If the verdict is guilty, jurors will be required to stay on for the penalty phase.\n\nThe trial for Daybell and Vallow will be a joint one. However, Vallow\u0027s trial is currently set for Oct. 11, 2022, while Daybell\u0027s is still scheduled to begin Jan. 9, 2023. Exactly how that will be reconciled is up in the air.\n\nAfter Vallow was declared competent to stand trial and transferred from a state mental health facility, Vallow was arraigned in district court on April 19. The judge set Vallow\u0027s trial for the October date because she had not waived her right to speedy trial.",

She\u0027s charged under an indictment issued in May 2021 with two counts of criminal conspiracy, two counts of first-degree murder, one count of conspiracy to commit murder, and one count of grand theft.\r\n\r\nInvestigators say her end-of-times beliefs led to the deaths of 7-year-old JJ Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan, who she allegedly told others had turned into zombies or become possessed by evil spirits. \r\n\r\nThe remains of the children were found in June 2020, buried on the Fremont County property of Lori Vallow\u0027s new husband, Chad Daybell.\r\n\r\nDaybell is also charged in the children\u0027s deaths, as well as the murder of his late wife Tammy Daybell, who was found dead the month before he and Vallow wed. \r\n\r\nThe arraignment marked the first in-person appearance for Vallow in more than a year. She was previously found mentally unfit to stand trial, a designation lifted earlier this month. \r\n\r\nShe entered the courtroom Tuesday afternoon wearing a powder blue blouse and matching eyeglasses, answering the judge\u0027s questions about whether she understood her rights in a soft voice. \r\n\r\nVallow\u0027s defense attorneys told the judge that she would not waive her right to a speedy trial, an unusual move in a homicide case. Under Idaho law, that means prosecutors have a deadline of six months - or roughly until mid-October to bring the case to trial.\r\n\r\nJudge Steven Boyce previously ruled that Vallow and Daybell be tried together, which could force officials to move Daybell\u0027s trial back from its planned date in January. Boyce announced in court that he will confer with prosecutors and attorneys for both defendants before setting an official trial date later this week.\r\n\r\nKay Woodcock, the grandmother of J.J., said after the hearing that it was \u0022unnerving\u0022 to see Vallow in person. \r\n\r\n\u0022I honestly thought I wouldn\u0027t feel anything, but I couldn\u0027t have been more wrong,\u0022 she said, as she began to cry. \u0022I look at her and think \u0027I love her, I trusted her. I trusted her with our life.\u0027\u0022\r\n\r\n\u0022With our baby, with my little man,\u0022 J.J.\u0027s grandfather Larry Woodcock agreed. \u0022It\u0027s senseless. It doesn\u0027t make sense.

And she knew all she had to do was call us.\u0022 \r\n\r\nIn a separate hearing earlier Tuesday morning, Daybell\u0027s defense lawyer argued that the trial should be held in Boise at the Ada County Courthouse, while the prosecution tried to convince the judge to bus an Ada County jury up to Fremont County in order to hold the proceeding in St. Anthony, a town of about 3,500. \r\n\r\nBringing the jury to St. Anthony would require them to be sequestered in a hotel, guarded by security around the clock and barred from access to their phones and electronic devices over the course of the trial, estimated to last ten weeks.\r\n\r\nBoyce had already ruled that the jury be pulled from a pool of Ada County residents, accepting the defense argument that the immense public interest and media attention on the case would make it near-impossible to assemble an unbiased jury in Fremont County. \r\n\r\nProsecutor Rachel Smith argued in court that holding the trial in Ada County would run up a massive bill for Fremont County to provide transportation, lodging, and food for detectives and other witnesses in the case, as well as leave the Fremont County Courthouse and Rexburg Police Department shorthanded as many of their senior officers are tied up 300 miles away for weeks at a time. \r\n\r\nRexburg Police Chief Shane Turman testified it would cost about $231 per day per person - not including transportation - to pay for food, lodging and hotels for officers and other personnel to attend the trial in Boise. \r\n\r\nTwelve witnesses would need to be there every day for ten weeks at that rate, he said, with three more present for five weeks, and 35 people for one week. \r\n\r\nKeeping the case in Fremont County will save on those costs, the prosecutor said.\r\n\r\n\u201CTrying it in Fremont County is the best thing all around, especially with the economic impact,\u0022 Smith argued. \u201CThis is where these people died. This is where these people were killed and buried. This is where the trial needs to be.\u201D",

Their bodies were discovered in June 2020, buried on Daybell\u0027s eastern Idaho property.\n\nThe six-part podcast sheds light on the cult-like, doomsday beliefs held by Vallow and Daybell.",

      "description": "The mother of two missing Rexburg children is due to make her first appearance in an Idaho courtroom Friday afternoon. \n\nVallow is charged with two felony counts of desertion and nonsupport of dependent children, as well as misdemeanor charges of resisting or obstructing officers, criminal solicitation to commit a crime, and contempt of court. \n\nShe was arrested in Hawaii in February in connection to the disappearance of 7-year-old JJ Vallow and 17-year-old Tylee Ryan. Both children were last seen in September. \n\nVallow and her new husband, Chad Daybell, have repeatedly refused to tell law enforcement what happened to the children. Daybell is not charged criminally in the case. \n\nThe felony charges are punishable by up to 14 years in prison. \n\nVallow arrived in Idaho Thursday as part of her extradition from Hawaii. After arriving in Boise, Vallow flew to Rexburg on an Idaho State Police-owned plane operated by the Idaho Transportation Department, according to a spokesperson from Idaho Gov. Brad Little\u0027s Office. Vallow was booked into the Madison County Jail Thursday evening.\n\nVallow\u0027s defense attorneys have indicated they will ask Judge Faren Eddins to reduce her bond, which is currently set a $5 million. A judge in Hawaii, where Vallow was taken into custody, denied a previous request to drop her bond to $100,000.\n\nSee our latest Lori Vallow coverage: https://www.ktvb.com/search-for-missing-rexburg-idaho-kids\n\nWe also have a YouTube playlist automatically populated with Lori Vallow updates: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipAN4MF0ZW4\u0026list=PLggbABFJJpUDG8dJYV_mCC63wODRC4Woy\n\nDownload the KTVB news app to get breaking news alerts and push alerts for significant updates to the Lori Vallow case: https://www.ktvb.com/appredirect",
