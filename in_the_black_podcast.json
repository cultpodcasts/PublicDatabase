      "description": "Sixteen years ago, Isabella escaped a messianic cult after the tragic murder of her son. A crime meant to protect the cult leader from exposure as a predator and conman. In this deeply moving conversation, Isabella opens up about the years of trauma, mind control, and abuse she endured and the extraordinary path she\u2019s taken to heal, reclaim her sovereignty, and help others break free from fear-based control systems.\nWe explore how she transformed unimaginable pain into purpose, the tools she uses to dismantle brainwashing and gaslighting, and her mission to help people live with optimal physical, mental, and spiritual health. Isabella\u2019s courage and wisdom will inspire you to confront your own limiting beliefs, step into your power, and live as a sovereign being.\nIf you\u2019ve ever faced abuse, manipulation, or deep loss and wondered if joy and freedom were still possible, this episode will remind you that healing is not only possible, it\u2019s your birthright.\n\nWhere to Find Isabella:\n\uD83C\uDF10 Website:\u2060 www.feelingbetternaturally.love\u2060\n\uD83D\uDCFA YouTube: \u2060Feeling Better Naturally\u2060\n\uD83D\uDCF0 Substack: \u2060Feeling Better Naturally\u2060\n\n\nFollow for more stories: \n\u2060@intheblackpassionproject\u2060",
