It used practices of neuro-linguistic programming or NLP to effectively \u0027brainwash\u0027 new recruits in their corporate cult. As NXIVM grew, Keith established an inner circle known as D.O.S or Dominus Obsequious Sororium. This is the insane story of how NXIVM manipulated thousands of people under the guise of self help. \n\n\nOther Links\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/philion\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/thirdeyeoftruth\nDISCORD: https://discord.gg/ubECAEB\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/philion/\nEMAIL: philionfit@gmail.com\n\nEdited by Philion x  PattyTrills: https://www.youtube.com/c/PattyTrills\n\nCopyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \u201Cfair use\u201D for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education and research.",

Now nearly 200 years old, it has spiraled into one of the fastest growing religions in the world. The actual history of Mormonism is one of absurdity, a completely fabricated story designed to fulfill Smith\u0027s agenda. Operating like a billion dollar corporation instead of a religion: this is the cult of mormonism. \n\n\nOther Links\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/philion\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/thirdeyeoftruth\nDISCORD: https://discord.gg/ubECAEB\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/philion/\nEMAIL: philionfit@gmail.com\n\n\nCopyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \u201Cfair use\u201D for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education and research.",
