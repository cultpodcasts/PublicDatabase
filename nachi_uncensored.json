      "description": "In this episode, I sit down with the daughter of a cult\u2014someone who was born into a world of strict control, secrecy, and manipulation. She shares her firsthand experience of life inside, the turning points that led to her escape, and how she\u2019s rebuilding her life outside the cult\u2019s influence. We dive into the psychological grip of cults, the challenges of breaking free, and the power of reclaiming one\u2019s identity. This is a conversation you don\u2019t\u00A0want\u00A0to\u00A0miss.\n\nThis pod is sponsored by Elegant Smile. \nwww.theelegantsmile.com\n\n\n#levtahor #cult #cultstory #nachiyavo #nachyyavo #ep2",
