      "title": "Is Tulsi Gabbard In A Cult?",
      "description": "Who is Tusli Gabbard really? \n\nShe\u0027s been a national figure for at least a decade, but the more we learn about her the weirder it gets. Gabbard first made national news when she bucked the rest of the Democratic party to endorse Bernie Sanders over Clinton in the 2016 primaries (good), but in the most recent election she supported Trump through and through (bad). To reward her loyalty, Trump selected her to be his Director of National Intelligence, a highly important job within the U.S. national security apparatus. \n\nTulsi is an enigmatic figure but one thing recently surfacing about the former Democrat is her family\u2019s ties to the Science of Identity Foundation. This organization is based in Hawaii and \u201Ccombines the teaching of yoga with aspects of Gaudiya Vaishnava theology.\u201D Though it seems benign on the surface, we spoke to the guys from the Conspirituality Podcast about what they believe is a cult. \n\nNearly 100 national security officials have signed on to a letter asking senators to take a harder look at Gabbard\u2019s appointment, in part, citing her relationship with the Science of Identity Foundation. At the same time, however, we should also be mindful of other powerful people in politics and their cult-like affiliations. For example, Justice Amy Coney Barret is part of the People of Praise\u2014which has a similar story. \n\nWhat do you think? Is this worth investigating further? \n\nCome see Francesca at The Ice House in Pasadena on Wednesday January 22nd with Aida Rodriguez, Matt Lieb, James Fritz and Chloe Hilliard. https://www.showclix.com/event/the-ice-house-new-world-disorder-1-22-25-7-30-pm\n\nGet 20% off SUNSET LAKE CBD with code FRANTIFA at check out.
