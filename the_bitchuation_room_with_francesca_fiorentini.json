      "title": "Is Richard Branson Threatening Me Over Epstein Files?",
      "description": "Looks like someone is getting nervous about the Epstein Files. Richard Branson\u2019s people sent us a threatening email because we accurately pointed out that he is in those files\u2026\n\nOn last week\u2019s show with Gareth Reynolds, we discussed the most recent dump of files that had come out. Wouldn\u2019t you know it, Branson showed up in a number of Jeff\u2019s emails. There is also a picture of the two men together that came out. Now, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Richard is guilty of any crimes, and we never said he was. But then we got an email from Branson\u2019s press department that told us there would be serious consequences for reporting inaccurate information.\n\nWe never accused Branson of grave wrongdoing in that episode, merely what his emails to Epstein suggest: that he was giving advice to Epstein on how to get out of his many assault allegations. Yet getting an email like this certainly makes him look scared. Why would you be scared if you haven\u2019t done anything wrong, Rich? Anyway, here is Virgin Groups statement again:\n\n\u201CAny contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than twelve years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event. When Epstein offered a charity donation, the Bransons asked their team to carry out due diligence before accepting the donation, which uncovered serious allegations. As a result of what the due diligence uncovered, Virgin Unite did not take the donation and Richard and Joan decided not to meet or speak with Epstein again. Had they had the full picture and information, there would have been no contact whatsoever \u2013 Richard believes that Epstein\u2019s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims.\u201D\n\nSee Francesca LIVE Saturday February 14th at 9:30pm Pasadena for New World Disorder:\nhttps://www.showclix.com/event/new-world-disorder-Valentines-Day-Edition-02-14-26-9-30-pm\n\nThe Bitchuation Room will be LIVE in Los Angeles with Emma Vigeland on Sunday March 22nd at Dynasty Typewriter.

      "title": "Is Tulsi Gabbard In A Cult?",
      "description": "Who is Tusli Gabbard really? \n\nShe\u0027s been a national figure for at least a decade, but the more we learn about her the weirder it gets. Gabbard first made national news when she bucked the rest of the Democratic party to endorse Bernie Sanders over Clinton in the 2016 primaries (good), but in the most recent election she supported Trump through and through (bad). To reward her loyalty, Trump selected her to be his Director of National Intelligence, a highly important job within the U.S. national security apparatus. \n\nTulsi is an enigmatic figure but one thing recently surfacing about the former Democrat is her family\u2019s ties to the Science of Identity Foundation. This organization is based in Hawaii and \u201Ccombines the teaching of yoga with aspects of Gaudiya Vaishnava theology.\u201D Though it seems benign on the surface, we spoke to the guys from the Conspirituality Podcast about what they believe is a cult. \n\nNearly 100 national security officials have signed on to a letter asking senators to take a harder look at Gabbard\u2019s appointment, in part, citing her relationship with the Science of Identity Foundation. At the same time, however, we should also be mindful of other powerful people in politics and their cult-like affiliations. For example, Justice Amy Coney Barret is part of the People of Praise\u2014which has a similar story. \n\nWhat do you think? Is this worth investigating further? \n\nCome see Francesca at The Ice House in Pasadena on Wednesday January 22nd with Aida Rodriguez, Matt Lieb, James Fritz and Chloe Hilliard. https://www.showclix.com/event/the-ice-house-new-world-disorder-1-22-25-7-30-pm\n\nGet 20% off SUNSET LAKE CBD with code FRANTIFA at check out.
