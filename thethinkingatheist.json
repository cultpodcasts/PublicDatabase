      "description": "SUPPORT OUR SPONSOR:  http://www.naturebox.com/thinkingatheist\n\nCreated by the late science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard, Scientology is a religion/cult which teaches that humans are actually immortal beings who, having forgotten their true nature, require intensive (and expensive) \u0022auditing\u0022 techniques to rediscover their true, immortal selves.\n\nReports and allegations have been made, by journalists, courts, and governmental bodies of several countries, that the Church of Scientology is an unscrupulous commercial enterprise that harasses its critics and brutally exploits its members.\n\nIn this compelling episode, we explore Scientology\u0027s practices, and we hear from those who escaped its shadow. \n\nTony Ortega \u0022The Underground Bunker:\u0022  http://tonyortega.org\n\nTory Christman\u0027s YouTube page:  https://www.youtube.com/user/ToryMagoo44\n\nMark Bunker\u0027s Knowledge Report: http://www.knowledgereport-themovie.com\n\nScientific American article \u0022The Real Science Behind Scientology\u0022: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-real-science-behind-scientology/",
