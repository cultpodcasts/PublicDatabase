      "description": "In this episode, I sit down with Dr. John Cornish, one of the original voices behind Recovering Grace, the landmark website that gave countless ATI/IBLP/Bill Gothard survivors a place to share their stories and find community.\n\nAs part of the admin team at Recovering Grace, John played a pivotal role in bringing public awareness to the damage caused by Bill Gothard\u2019s teachings. In our conversation, he reflects on his own journey, the history of the site, and the turning points that helped shift the narrative for so many of us who grew up inside the system.\n\nThis is an honest and insightful look at how one grassroots project helped spark a wider movement of survivor voices.\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 Don\u2019t forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more conversations with survivors and experts Across the Cultiverse.\n\nwww.recoveringgrace.org\nMy Story on Recovering Grace:  Sacred Grooming",
