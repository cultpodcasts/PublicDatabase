      "title": "Are You in a Christian Cult?",
      "description": "In this video, I dive into the topic of dysfunctional Christian churches or cults, how to recognize the signs of a Christian cult, and what to prepare for if you decide to break free from dysfunctional teachings or unhealthy religious environments. I talk about the book Becoming Free Indeed by Jinger Duggar Vuolo and offer encouragement for those who are questioning the things they\u0027re being taught without completely deconstructing their faith.\n\n\nINDEPENDENT BOOK SELLERS:\nhttps://www.abebooks.com",
