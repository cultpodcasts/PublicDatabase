      "description": "This week we tell a chilling story from Martin County, Kentucky. This episode recounts the harrowing events of January 9, 1933, when the quiet community of Tomahawk was rocked by a gruesome discovery. The lifeless body of a 72-year-old woman was found in her mountain cabin, the victim of a bizarre ritual led by her own son, John H. Mills. The story unfolds with details of religious hysteria, frenzied rituals, and the tragic consequences of blind faith and the subsequent trial that shocked the nation.\n\nGive us a thumbs up if you don\u2019t mind and don\u0027t forget to subscribe for more Stories of Appalachia.   \n\nYou can also support our storytelling journey and access exclusive content by becoming a patron on our audio podcast home here:\n\nhttps://www.spreaker.com/podcast/stories-of-appalachia--5553692/support\n\nThank you for listening and for sharing our stories with your friends!\n#podcast\n#AppalachianMountainStories #StoriesOfAppalachia #MartinCountyKy #FamilyCult #JohnHMills #LucindaMills #1933KentuckyCult #BizarreRituals #AppalachianHistory #FaithAndMadness",
