      "description": "For decades, Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses have held a prohibition on men having facial hair, more specifically beards. There has been a calling from some of the branch offices of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses for clarification on whether or not men should be allowed to have beards in the organization. On December 15, the Governing Body finally gave this clarification. Is this what you were expecting?",

It ultimately led to the discussion of having limited contact to safeguard her heart against the possibility that I could lure her away from \u0022the truth\u0022. Join me as I discuss how this went and what it means when Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses tell their unbelieving family members that they will need to limit their contact.",

      "description": "My dad passed away this last week and right away I began to hear the rhetoric of the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses starting. First I was told if I wanted to see my dad again in the resurrection that I would need to make a choice in my faith. Then close friends of the family began really pushing meeting attendance. I began thinking this isn\u0027t what it means to grieve the loss of a loved one. This week we dig into how Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses view death and the afterlife. We have transitioned over from using the New World Translation to fully using the KJV unless the scripture is directly quoted from a source of The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society.

      "description": "Sorry sorry sorry. I know I am a day late and I have received a few texts asking when this will be posted. Had a hectic day yesterday and as you can see this is my longest episode to date. So I wanted to ensure I devoted as much as possible to recording instead of trying to rush in between house cleaning yesterday. For those who are still Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses or studying to become a Jehovah\u0027s Witness, this is your episode to identify the red flags of what a cult is and how that corresponds to the religion you are currently a part of. For those of us who have already left we see these as subtle reminders of why we should never look behind but forward. This week I referenced the jw.org website, a howstuffworks.com article entitled, \u0022How Cults Work\u0022, Netflix \u0022Explained: Cults\u0022, and various articles from Dr. Robert Jay Lifton.
