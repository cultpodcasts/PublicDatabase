      "description": "You\u2019ve heard of six-minute abs, but how about the 15-minute orgasm? That\u2019s what Nicole Daedone of OneTaste was touting; female empowerment through clitoris stimulation. Then like most high-demand groups, things go south pretty quickly. In this Strange Country episode, co hosts Beth and very uncomfortable Kelly talk about the rise and fall of OneTaste. Theme music: Big White Lie by\u00A0A Cast of Thousands.
