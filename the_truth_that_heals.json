      "description": "For many years I found it difficult to trust myself. The cult spends countless hours telling the members that they are all bad and that the leaders and founder are super holy. While they said that all they were doing was good, I couldn\u0027t help but feel confused because deep inside my heart I felt like something was wrong. But like I said, we weren\u0027t allowed to trust our own intuitions or make our own decisions.\nFor a few years even after leaving the cult I still felt bound by their narratives that those who leave are good for nothing and misfits in this world. But after some deep thinking and soul searching I began to see through the lies and the false narratives that the cult had been feeding me throughout all those years.\nAs soon as I was able to separate the cults narrative from the truth, I was able to better understand what happened to me and from there know myself a lot better, and love myself for who I truly am.\n\nIf you would like to support my channel please consider:\nhttp://buymeacoffee.com/truththath7\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/truththathealspod\n\nThank you for all of your support and for helping to make this channel a reality :)",

Inside of that environment we were told to stay away from any negative commentary and to view ex members, or even current members who were struggling, as enemies.\nIt was with that fear in mind that I had a hard time to openly talk about it.\nBut here I am talking about it. It took me a long time to get here and here I am :)",

      "description": "From Rosie:\nAbout Me\nRosie was born in Southern California\n\nCome from large family on both sides of my parents and step parents.\n\nI am German and indigenous Mexico descendant.\n\n59 years old\n\nHave/ had 2 children,\nLost a son, he was sixteen and my mother at a double homicide in 2002.\n\nMy mother and step father raised me Baptist and non denominational, but went to pentecostal with my neighbor friends.\n\nMom taught me religious biblical texts.\n\nAs an young 20 year old I started searching for truth. Some sort of religion to save me from abuse I endured at the hands of my step father. My brother and myself had endured to be more exact. My mother was emotionally abused.\n\nI went to many other denominations before Jehovahs witnesses.\n\nIn 1985 I study books and Bible with Jehovahs witnesses. I thought they were decent people and they taught me God hates violence.\n32 years later, I learned that misogyny, hidden child abuse, domestic violence wS permitted in that organization. Victims were told to not tell anyone of any abuse and bible says you have to stay with abusers.\n\nHowever, for me I escaped 3 times because I didn\u0027t agree. I almost died at the hand of my children\u0027s father. 1987.\n\nOver the years from my 20\u0027s, 30\u0027s, 40\u0027s and early 50\u0027s I would leave Jws, go back, leave, go back. .\nBut as of today sine 2019 my journey has stopped completely with Jehovahs Witnesses. \n\nThe only Journey I have now is freedom from a controlling cult since 2019.\n\nI can choose dreams and goals with no guilt if displeasing there god that punishes all who don\u0027t conform.\n\nI look at our lives, my life as a beautiful flowing river.\nEach flow of water moves and turns in the bends of a river. Sometimes a river slows or trickles along the way until the next strong rain fall.\nAll the movement in a free flowing river is my life. When a log or large rocks are in the flow of the river, it\u0027s my life and the obstacles or change of path that I need to choose to move. Over rocks or large boulders are just what water does, it flows over, around and under to keep moving.\nMy healing journey from childhood abuse and religious abuse was the large boulders in my path of life. \nAt times my river of life did not flow well. It stopped if my decisions were not the best. But once I realized I had to keep moving, nothing could stand in my way.\n I choose to help others to keep moving on there river of life. \nThat\u0027s why I started sharing some of my life on different forms.\nI love to share kind and caring  words to help others. \n\nWe cannot stop living because others try to suppress who we are.\n\nOur lives are beutiful, we have and can have a free flowing spirit within. \n\nI have seen in my travels, especially Oregon,...great beauty. And, large rivers make me feel alive. They shimmer in the sun. Life flurishes in a beautiful free flowing body of water.\n\nWhen we recognize in ourselves, \u0022 Hey I need to heal,\u0022 then that person who was in pain releases that block of large boulders from our lives, then the living starts again.\n\nJust looking at life in that perspective has Givin me a more renewed sense of loving. Nature in all it\u0027s glory can teach us to live again, no matter what part in our life has slowed down, or is trickling slowly....it can come alive again, it will start moving once we can and will decide to journey on and not let obstacles keep us down.\n\nLife is to precious to stop living.\n Leave your logs and rapids and water falls behind. Start your river again, let it shine and let life begin.\n\nRosie Rodriguez\n\nYoutube channel:  shewokeup_exjw7680.\nInstagram: rosiemarie_yt\nTiktok: @shewokeup_exjw\n\nMy favorite Influencers who helped me in my journey to heal are....\nYoutube channel:\nExjw critical thinker with JT and Lady C.\nAlso exjw criticalthinker.com\n\nLloyd Evans on Youtube:\n@Lloydevans \nJwwatch.org\n\nYoutube:\nRickFeron of 6screens",

Many will say that I wasn\u0027t trafficked and that I chose that life. The truth is many of us couldn\u0027t leave. The superiors of the group held onto our passports and other important documents to make sure that we wouldn\u0027t leave and some ex members even had their visas ripped out of their passports to keep them from leaving. Some will say that I wasn\u0027t being trafficked. I say I was trafficked. What do you say?  ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/ryan-anthony-hernandez/support",

      "description": "Once you are in an End Times Cult it\u0027s as if you have been frozen in time. All you look forward to are persecutions and THE END. After being inside for so long I finally found my freedom however I soon discovered that I still felt trapped. I felt like a prisoner and a part of me wanted to go back to the cult. I didn\u0027t have any life skills. I didn\u0027t have any idea of what the real world was like. I was trained, or programmed, to look at education and relationships as something toxic. It took quite a while for me to untangle my thoughts from the lies and to finally break free and find peace with life in the outside world. While I thought I was preparing for the end I now look back and think how controlling the community leaders were to the point that we had to see abuse as a gift from God, or as a reflection of God\u0027s infinite love.I want to share my story as well as the dirty side of my story such as the depression, the loneliness, the heartaches, so that the viewer may understand what life is like for someone who has left an end times cult. Not everyone went through what I experienced however I am sure that there are many who left not knowing what to do with their life. Feeling like you were hated by God, hated by the community, and that your life was damned. If the cult leaders are in charge of the narrative you will only see doom and gloom. It is my hope that survivors of cult abuse, of abuse within a Catholic Community that pretends to follow Christ while beating the members, it is my hope that survivors take back the narrative and live their life with peace. These cult leaders even wounded my religious faith nonetheless I have been on a path towards healing, forgiveness, love, and courage.To support my journey and my channel check out my links:Linktree: https://linktr.ee/truththathealspodPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Truththathealspodcast/posts  ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/ryan-anthony-hernandez/support",

      "description": "Purity Culture has been coming up a lot lately in my quest to understand life, religion, trauma, and healing. To get a better understanding of what this culture was like I sat down and discussed this theme with Erin so that my understanding of it would be clearer. We talked about some of the good things regarding purity, but, we also talked about the things that many don\u0027t want to be talked about, or, the dark side of purity culture. While many may think that Purity Culture only focuses on staying virgin one will begin to see that there is a lot of judgement and shaming in this environment. Also, in many instances, the youth are being formed to look upon the body as something dirty. Many who are brought up in the system of purity have neglected other Christian virtues such as patience and kindness. Also, there seems to be a strong rush to condemn and beat down on those who don\u0027t reach the standards of purity which opens the door for shame and at times even trauma depending on the scenario.

      "description": "One of the hardest things for me to do is to breakdown the story of my cult experience in a way that is not complicated or all over the place. My journey inside the cult has been difficult at times to talk about, even to this day, but for me to tell my story I believe that it is best to simplify things to make the cult experience understandable for those who were not members. In no way is this episode an attempt to bash those who seek to live a life of purity and who cherish the chaste life. Not at all. Instead I simply wish to shed light on how the cult and leaders used purity as a way to bring guilt, control, and even fear upon members. It was even used as a tactic to recruit members by telling young adults that if they didn\u0027t \u0022try God first they would regret it.\u0022 Hopefully by listening to this episode people, including former cult members, will understand that there was a lot of abuse of power as well as terrible spiritual direction on the part of some of the superiors within the group. It is my desire by sharing my story that people will understand what we went through and that if there are people who feel guilt or shame from the experience may find freedom from the psychological, and at times physical, torture we endured.

Furthermore, Radiant Style breaks it down for us about how \u0022Purity Culture\u0022 was used to shame and control members, especially the women. While purity was hammered down upon the women and so much focus was given to modesty she noticed that there was a lack of attention on other important issues like morality, consent, boundaries, and the understanding of what it means to be a good person.

      "description": "My Healing Journey after leaving the End Times Cult has not been easy and it\u2019s definitely not over yet. It is my goal that by sharing my journey people will begin to understand what life was like living under Fr. Bing\u2019s End Times Cult. Spending time alone in an End Times basement was one of the darkest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. Nuclear war was right around the corner. We were told to drink colloidal silver as that would keep us safe from any sickness including nuclear radiation. Also, Fr. Bing told us to cover the windows with black trash bags because that would keep us safe from any nuclear fallout or radioactive contamination. This is my story.

Bing to keep members silent about abuses in the community.                                      I was put on silence and expected to be in prayer like a robot. Dead to emotions and dead to myself. I was expected to \u201Crejoice\u201D when I received obedience that gave me suffering because that was how a \u201Cvictim soul\u201D is supposed to behave. But this theology gave a pass to superiors to be abusive and even harsh because as victim souls members were trained to rejoice because the more pain we received we had to see it as a gift from God.

It hasn\u0027t been easy but I am glad that I found the courage to do this. Secondly, I wanted to talk about suffering. There are so many discussions that can be recorded on suffering and I wanted to focus on the way the cult sees suffering: they pretty much glorified it... versus the suffering that people endure while trying to be virtuous. It\u0027s hard to really explain but I am just sharing my thoughts on the cults way of viewing suffering and how they pushed this narrative that suffering was good in order to allow abuse to happen.

      "description": "As a former OATH member I witnessed a split in the group. On the one hand I saw the side of the members who wanted to practice their faith peacefully and on the other side I saw the development of cult tactics, bullying, paranoia and manipulation, as well as beatings.\nIn this episode I seek to find a name for the group that I was in. It is so difficult for me, a member of the OATH for 11 years, to truly identify the name. I can\u0027t say its all AHFI because the AHFI members did not live with Fr. Bing or the other superiors as I did.\nOnce the Vatican got involved and freed us from slavery under Fr. Bing I saw a freedom that I had never seen before in the group.\nThe OATH (one of the six institutes founded by Fr. Bing outside of the AHFI yet still connected with the AHFI) and a few other institutes decided to follow the changes brought upon by Rome, the Vatican, and one of those changes was the removal of Fr. Bing and his loyalists from being in charge and holding all the power.\nFrom what I witnessed, the SITH, under the leadership of Anges Frias, who was a big bully to me and others, decided not to follow those changes by the Vatican and instead follow Fr. Bing all while not being transparent to the members nor being totally transparent to the AHFI members and the family members.\nToday the OATH and the LIHM are institutes that I respect because they freed themselves from the culty grip of Bing and Agnes and from what I understand, are even treating the members with dignity and respect.\nAs for the SITH members, or whatever they call themselves today, I am greatly concerned because of how abusive and mean I remember Agnes Frias was. Then with Fr. Bing and his extreme paranoia... you never know exactly what he will do next. But for sure he will always find a way to make himself the victim of the story.\nSo what is the name of the group? They have so many names so I am just gonna call it The Bing Movement Cult to sum it all up. All the different names makes the whole thing so much more confusing. Or should it be called The Cult of Bing Arellano? I dont know",

As your can hear from my voice I am so rusty and nervous but I felt that it was time to get back to doing something which I find to be exciting. Not long ago my father passed away. I always looked up to him and seeing him helpless on his deathbed sort of woke me up on the need to give life my best and to follow my dad\u0027s example of putting love in everything he did.  At the end of this episode I put a challenge on my listeners to try to practice doing an act of love throughout the day or throughout the week. I\u0027m still new at this so please be patient as I work on my podcast speaking skills.

I thought I was just joining a good religious community until I discovered after leaving that in fact the way some superiors ran the show was very cult like. The side that wanted to do things the right way are being very transparent and are working on doing things the right way and I applaud them for their endeavors. The side that went with Fr. Bing however are still in the dark and are unable to see the lack of transparency of the Founder. Fr. Bing, it is high time that you make a public apology, along with other members who were abusive as well to do the same. You have the power to do something good in this life and it starts with being transparent and apologize in public.  ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/ryan-anthony-hernandez/support",
