      "description": "Talk of Donald Trump becoming a dictator is becoming normalized, and even celebrated by elements of the MAGA movement. Dr. Steven Hassan is an expert in cults and brainwashing, and helps explain the cultish nature of Donald Trump\u2019s appeal to his followers. He also discusses how their misguided beliefs can be most effectively challenged by family members and loved ones.
