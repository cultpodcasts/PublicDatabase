      "title": "Goldman Lawyer, Epstein Conferred on Secret Service Sex Scandal",
      "description": "Kathryn Ruemmler, who resigned last week as the top lawyer at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., corresponded with Jeffrey Epstein about a prostitution scandal that engulfed the US Secret Service during her tenure as White House counsel under former President Barack Obama. In a dozen or so exchanges that were sent months after Ruemmler left her White House position in 2014, she complained to Epstein about \u201Cthis secret service crap\u201D and forwarded to him a\u00A0draft email\u00A0that contained detailed, nonpublic information about the behind-the-scenes role the White House Counsel\u2019s office played in investigating the 2012 prostitution scandal.\u00A0Although Ruemmler had left the White House, she remained embroiled in the matter as lawmakers and journalists probed her work investigating the scandal. At the time she was under consideration\u00A0for US attorney general. Bloomberg News Senior Investigative Reporter Jason Leopold joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss. He speaks with Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec. \r\n--------\r\nWatch Bloomberg Radio LIVE on YouTube\r\nWeekdays 7am-6pm ET\r\nWATCH HERE: http://bit.ly/3vTiACF\r\n \r\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/BloombergRadio\r\n\r\nSubscribe to our Podcasts:\r\n\r\n    Bloomberg Daybreak: http://bit.ly/3DWYoAN\r\n    Bloomberg Surveillance: http://bit.ly/3OPtReI\r\n    Bloomberg Intelligence: http://bit.ly/3YrBfOi\r\n    Balance of Power: http://bit.ly/3OO8eLC\r\n    Bloomberg Businessweek: http://bit.ly/3IPl60i\r\n\r\nListen on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business app:\r\nApple CarPlay: https://apple.co/486mghI\r\nAndroid Auto: https://bit.ly/49benZy\r\n \r\nVisit our YouTube channels:\r\nBloomberg Podcasts: https://www.youtube.com/bloombergpodcasts\r\nBloomberg Television: https://www.youtube.com/@markets\r\nBloomberg Originals: https://www.youtube.com/bloomberg\r\nQuicktake: https://www.youtube.com/@BloombergQuicktake",
