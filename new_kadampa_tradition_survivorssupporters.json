      "title": "Anti-NKT Protest Outside Class in Putney - February 25, 2016",
      "description": "[On the video, the protesters are saying \u0027Stop exploiting Tibetan Buddhism\u0027, \u0027Shame on you\u0027 and \u0027Stay away from Tibetans\u0027...Neil Elliott can be seen walking past the protesters into the teaching venue accompanied by a Chinese NKT nun who teaches NKT Dharma in London in Chinese...]\n\nHi folks, just a brief report on today\u0027s demonstration against Neil Elliott held outside his teaching at Putney Library, SW London. Arriving at 1850hrs I met our Tibetan friends where we organised the leaflets (good work on those by the way). We began distributing leaflets to passers-by when a member of our party informed me that Neil and a nun were enjoying a beverage in a local coffee shop. Said party member told me that he thought Neil looked unwell and appeared somewhat frail - struggling to don his coat, scarf etc.\n\nShortly afterwards Neil and the nun came walking towards us where he was greeted with cries of \u0022shame on you\u0022, and other statements I didn\u0027t quite catch as I was too busy recording the event. Neil was shocked and taken aback by the event. This is certainly not something to which he is accustomed. Regaining composure, he appeared aloof and I dare say contemptuous.\nAround 11 members of the public attended the event. There were 9 activists. We stood with a banner where other members of the group distributed further leaflets to those attending the course and other passing members of the public. One gentleman became very angry with our demonstration, declaring he \u0022would not waste his time researching such nonsense\u0022. He was really very upset. He said he knows what he is talking about as he is a Buddhist. Perhaps lacking awareness that he was talking to 8 Tibetans. Someone mentioned they are campaigning for the NKT to stop exploiting their religion. He replied that \u0022Buddhism is a philosophy and not a religion\u0022. Everyone laughed. He became puce with anger and threatened to call the police.\n\nMembers of the public stopped and chatted with us, showing genuine curiosity and support for our course. Two even offered to take pictures for us (on our phones). Once the teaching started we left and had refreshments and conversation.\n\nMy concluding thoughts are: The event was a stark awakening for Neil. He will now be aware that we are serious in damaging his business and most importantly, offering those attending his classes a different narrative. Speaking to the public and those attending the class offered considerable value to what we are trying to achieve. Direction action is powerful, it means we are no longer words on a screen, or a figures in video clips, but real people with a voice and motivation to act with compassion.\n\nhttp://www.kmclondon.org/meditation-classes-putney",

Shortly after this video was taken, which is a walk through one of three NKT/ISC protest areas, the protesters crossed the road, facilitated by the police in the name of \u0027freedom of speech\u0027 and, standing directly behind the main stage at the gate of Aldershot Football Stadium shouted and drummed so loudly that neither the Dalai Lama nor the Mayor of Aldershot could be heard clearly.\nNear the end of the video Gen Kelsang Dekyong, Spiritual Director of the NKT, can be seen close to the camera. Neil Elliott can be seen in the first few minutes seated beside the table where attendees appear to be paying. You can experience what it feels like to be \u0027in\u0027 the NKT.
