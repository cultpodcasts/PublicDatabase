He is the author of\u00A0Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief;\u00A0The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11; and\u00A0The Plague Year: America in the Time of Covid.\n\nWright talks with Reason\u0027s Nick Gillespie about The Human Scale, his new novel set in the war-torn Middle East, and why the Israeli-Palestinian conflict keeps burning even as most of the 20th century\u0027s conflicts have cooled. They also go deep on Wright\u0027s expos\u00E9s on the war on terror,\u00A0satanic panics, and how our craving for belief can lead us to madness. Then they turn to Texas, Wright\u0027s home state and the place he says is the future of America. What exactly does it mean that we\u0027re all becoming more like Lone Star State?\n\nThis discussion took place at a live event in New York City.\n\nVideo editor: Ian Keyser",
