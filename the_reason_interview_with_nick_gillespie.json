      "description": "The Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning author discusses the enduring roots of Middle Eastern conflict, the rise and fall of cultural panics, and why Texas may be the blueprint\u2014and battleground\u2014for America\u0027s future.\n\n0:00\u2014 Introduction\n1:20\u2014 Texas: the future of American politics\n3:17\u2014 \u2018The Human Scale\u2019\n5:38\u2014 Why the Israel-Palestine conflict endures\n12:12\u2014 \u2018Thirteen Days In September\u2019 and the Camp David Accords\n23:37\u2014 America as both egocentric bully and colony for the rest of the world\n26:17\u2014 \u2018Remembering Satan\u2019 and the \u2018recovered memories\u2019 panic\n33:29\u2014 How abortion anxiety may have fueled a moral panic\n37:07\u2014 Insurance companies ended the panic by denying quack psychiatric treatments\n39:15\u2014 The will to believe often overrides logic and evidence\n40:55\u2014 Wright\u2019s teenage religious fervor led to interest in Scientology\n42:19\u2014 How Scientology seduced Hollywood\n47:26\u2014 \u2018Going clear\u2019 and Scientology backlash\n50:03\u2014 Getting Paul Haggis on the record about Scientology\n52:55\u2014 Texas in American mythology\n\nhttps://reason.com/podcast/2025/05/28/lawrence-wright-americas-misadventures-in-wars-cults-and-panics/\n---\nToday\u0027s guest is the legendary journalist and New Yorker staffer\u00A0Lawrence Wright. He is the author of\u00A0Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief;\u00A0The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11; and\u00A0The Plague Year: America in the Time of Covid.\n\nWright talks with Reason\u0027s Nick Gillespie about The Human Scale, his new novel set in the war-torn Middle East, and why the Israeli-Palestinian conflict keeps burning even as most of the 20th century\u0027s conflicts have cooled. They also go deep on Wright\u0027s expos\u00E9s on the war on terror,\u00A0satanic panics, and how our craving for belief can lead us to madness. Then they turn to Texas, Wright\u0027s home state and the place he says is the future of America. What exactly does it mean that we\u0027re all becoming more like Lone Star State?\n\nThis discussion took place at a live event in New York City.\n\nVideo editor: Ian Keyser",
