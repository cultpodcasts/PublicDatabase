Led by married duo Logan and Ashley, Mystic Rebels markets itself as the sole authority on \u201Creal astrology,\u201D mirroring the control tactics seen in Twin Flames Universe. Taylor shares her experience being drawn into the group through TikTok and facing steep fees and exploitative practices, including Mystic Rebels taking a cut of members\u0027 own business earnings. When she dared to explore astrology outside of their teachings, Taylor encountered the group\u2019s intense pressure to conform. After going public with the substantial money she paid to Mystic Rebels, Taylor began her own venture, Black Moon Taylor. Following her exit, however, she was publicly denounced by the leaders as a \u201Cfalse teacher.\u201D Through this experience, Taylor grew convinced of Mystic Rebels\u2019 cult-like nature, especially after they rebranded from Vibe Tribe in an attempt to appear more positive. Now, Taylor advocates for those questioning online groups, encouraging critical thinking, thorough research, and an understanding of healthy community boundaries.

      "description": "Ep. #41 Unmasking the Seventh-day Adventist Church: Melissa\u0027s Deconstruction Please consider buying us a cup of coffee or two by clicking here. Your support helps fund our out of pocket expenses In this episode Cultimatum, we dive deep into the complex and often hidden world of the Seventh-day Adventist Church with Melissa Dugie Spiers, a fourth-generation ex-member. Melissa is currently writing a revealing book about her life in the church and the historical roots that shaped its practices. From the strict observance of the Saturday Sabbath to following biblical laws, Melissa grew up in a controlled environment that isolated her from the outside world. The episode explores the influence of Ellen G. White, the church\u2019s prophetic founder, who shaped the sect\u2019s strict beliefs. Melissa delves into the lesser-known history of White, including her possible mercury poisoning from her father\u2019s hat-making business and a traumatic brain injury as a child, leading to speculation about her mental and physical health. Melissa sheds light on how White may have suffered from Gastaut-Geschwind Syndrome, a neurological disorder that shaped her behaviors and prophecies, which laid the foundation for the church\u0027s controversial doctrines\u2014such as anti-masturbation, anti-LGBTQ beliefs, and rigid lifestyle restrictions. Melissa\u0027s personal journey of escape began at 17 when she left the church\u2019s controlled bubble and moved to New York. For years, she buried her past, until a revelation involving a known child predator being protected by the SDA leadership reopened old wounds. This discovery propelled Melissa into her deconstruction process and inspired her to start speaking out, particularly through her growing TikTok platform, where she exposes disturbing truths about the church with factual references. In this episode, Melissa advises those still in the SDA or any cult-like group to critically assess their personal boundaries, use critical thinking, and do thorough research. Whether you are considering joining or questioning your involvement, this is a must-listen episode packed with insight into the Seventh-day Adventist Church\u2019s darker side and the journey of healing after leaving. Join us as Melissa courageously shares her story, challenges the SDA\u0027s practices, and encourages others to find their path to freedom.

      "description": "Ep. #40 Shattered Faith: Harry\u0027s Escape from the House of Yahweh Please consider buying us a cup of coffee or two by clicking here. Your support helps fund our out of pocket expenses In this compelling episode, we delve into the harrowing experiences of \u0022Harry,\u0022 an anonymous former member of the House of Yahweh. Harry joined the cult in 1995, only to witness a dramatic shift in its teachings around the year 2000. Members were increasingly subjected to oppressive controls, including needing the leader\u0027s permission to marry, paying a bride price, and undergoing so-called \u0022betrothal counseling.\u0022 By 2003, the group\u0027s practices had become even more extreme, with a literal wall erected in the sanctuary to divide men from women. The leadership\u0027s desire for total control extended to every aspect of members\u0027 lives, including who they could see, talk to, and marry. The woman Harry was interested in was taken by the leader, Yisrayl Hawkins, as one of his many wives and concubines\u2014a devastating blow that marked a turning point for Harry and others in the group. As the group\u2019s teachings became increasingly rigid and abusive, questions about the future leadership and the group\u0027s direction were met with swift excommunication. The cult\u2019s indoctrination methods were further entrenched by limiting education, particularly for women, with most members being homeschooled and receiving little education beyond the 5th grade. Harry sheds light on the shocking realities of life inside the House of Yahweh, where young women are treated as property, and the cult has become a breeding ground for pedophiles under the guise of religious doctrine. Women are often forced into marriages, living in dilapidated conditions, completely dependent on the men who control their every move. Fear of eternal damnation keeps many members trapped, while the cult\u2019s strict control over sexuality has led to disturbing practices, including bestiality. After a near-death experience, Harry broke free from the cult in 2005, realizing that staying meant a life without the possibility of a partner or wife. Today, Harry is thriving and no longer believes in the fear-based teachings that once kept him captive. He emphasizes the importance of education and self-awareness, reflecting on how absolute power corrupts absolutely. This episode is a powerful testament to the resilience of the human spirit and a sobering reminder of the dangers of unchecked religious authority. Harry\u2019s voice is altered to protect his identity, but his story will resonate with anyone who has ever questioned the true cost of blind faith.

      "description": "In this thought-provoking episode, we sit down with Brooke Walker, a former member of the Church of Immortal Consciousness, a cult she was brought into at just 8 years old. Led by the trance medium Trina Camp and her husband Steven, the group created a tight-knit community where families lived together, practiced arranged marriages, and believed in a unique connection to God through non-denominational reincarnation. Brooke shares her story of growing up in this controlling environment, where children were expected to surpass their parents and be grateful for the \u0022opportunity\u0022 to learn from their mistakes. Emotional was common and physical abuse happened occasionally, by the time she was 17, Brooke was forced into an arranged marriage. The situation worsened over time, with her husband leaving the group when she was only 22, leaving her to raise two children within the cult\u2019s oppressive structure. The Church of Immortal Consciousness operated without a physical church building, instead focusing on practices like \u0022breaking down your brackets,\u0022 a grueling process involving hours of yelling, drinking, and emotional manipulation. The group\u0027s leaders wielded their supposed spiritual powers to control members, exploiting them for financial gain while keeping them in fear of eternal damnation if they left. Brooke\u2019s breaking point came as her family started to fall apart, with rebellious teenagers. At 35, she finally made the courageous decision to leave, despite the enormous personal cost of losing everyone she knew. Now, Brooke has transformed her painful experiences into a powerful message of healing and resilience. She hosts the podcast \u0022How to Leave a Cult,\u0022 where she delves deeper into her story and helps others navigate the difficult path of deconstruction. Brooke\u2019s advice is clear: ask the right questions, ensure your relationships are healthy, and take baby steps toward healing without triggering yourself.

      "description": "#36 Carol Merchasin: Advocating Justice for Cult Survivors In this episode of the Cultimatum podcast, host Andrew and co-host Melody engage with Carol Merchasin, an expert in cult law, discussing her journey into representing victims of cults and the complexities of legal advocacy in this field. They explore the challenges faced by survivors in recognizing their abuse, the slow legal processes involved, and the need for reform in laws surrounding coercion and consent. The conversation highlights the psychological impact of cults on individuals and the importance of community support in helping survivors navigate their experiences. In this conversation, the speakers delve into the complexities of cult leadership, the emotional and legal challenges faced by survivors, and the importance of community support and awareness in preventing cult involvement. They discuss the manipulative tactics used by cult leaders, the long journey of healing for survivors, and the legal processes involved in holding cults accountable for their actions. The conversation emphasizes the need for critical thinking and the role of support systems in the recovery process. takeaways Takeaways Carol Merchasin transitioned from a corporate lawyer to advocate for cult survivors. Many people have stereotypes about cult survivors that hinder understanding. Legal systems often struggle to address abuses within cults due to their religious cloaking. The process of bringing cases against cults is slow and complicated. Consent in cult situations is often not informed due to coercion. Human trafficking laws may provide a new avenue for addressing cult abuses. Survivors often need time to recognize their victimization due to brainwashing. The civil justice system is primarily about monetary compensation, complicating cases. There is a need for legal reform to better protect cult survivors. Community support is crucial for survivors to regain their agency. The manipulation tactics of cult leaders often change to fit their agenda. Survivors may take years to recognize the abuse they endured. Legal action against cults can be complicated and requires specific evidence. Community support is crucial for survivors seeking justice. Awareness and education can help prevent future cult involvement. Healing is a personal journey that varies for each survivor. Survivors often experience shame due to societal misconceptions about cults. Multiple survivors coming forward can strengthen a legal case. The legal system is slowly evolving to better support survivors. Raising awareness is key to holding cults accountable.

      "description": "Ep. #35 Breaking the Chains: Heidi\u0027s Journey Out of the Seventh-day Adventist Church In this eye-opening episode, we dive into the life of Heidi Odell, a fourth-generation former member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Heidi\u0027s lineage traces back to the very origins of the church, with her great-great-great-grandmother, Ellen White, present at the infamous \u0022Great Disappointment\u0022 on October 20, 1844. This event, marked by the failed prophecy of Christ\u2019s return, became a pivotal moment in the church\u0027s history. Heidi shares the complexities of her family\u0027s deep-rooted connection to the church, including Ellen White\u2019s controversial visions, which some believe were influenced by mercury poisoning due to her father\u0027s occupation as a hatter. These visions, which sought to rationalize the failed prophecy, laid the foundation for what would become a global religious movement. Despite her empathy and understanding for those still within the church, Heidi recounts her personal struggles, including enduring abuse at the hands of her father, who suffered from untreated mental illness. Kicked out of her home at 13 after speaking out about the abuse, Heidi began a long journey of self-discovery and deconstruction, ultimately leaving the church in 2012. Heidi\u2019s story is one of resilience and healing. After divorcing in 2015 and facing backlash from the church for becoming a surrogate in 2018, she has turned to yoga, hypnotherapy, and deep research into the church\u0027s history as part of her recovery. Today, she fully disbelieves in the teachings of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and is passionate about helping others on their journey of self-discovery. In this episode, Heidi emphasizes the importance of leaving when the time is right for you and encourages listeners to trust themselves, do their own research, and build communities outside of religious institutions. Her insights into the Seventh-day Adventist Church and her own personal evolution make this a must-listen episode for anyone interested in religious deconstruction and healing.

      "description": "Ep# 34 Cult Anatomy -Unmasking Control, Manipulation \u0026 Brainwashing In this episode of Cultimatum, co-hosts Anonymous Andrew and Melody dive deep into the anatomy of cults, exploring how manipulation, control, and brainwashing tactics are used across different settings\u2014religious groups, MLMs, and even spiritual or wellness movements. They break down the nuances of high-control groups, revealing how cult-like tactics often appear in unexpected places, from yoga classes to multi-level marketing schemes. Using real-life examples from previous episodes, such as Mandy\u2019s experience with Potter\u2019s House (Ep. #6) and Kim Peirano\u2019s journey (Ep. #28), the hosts illustrate the subtle and overt methods used to manipulate followers. They also introduce Steven Hassan\u2019s BITE Model, explaining how cults control behavior, information, thoughts, and emotions to keep members loyal and dependent. Whether it\u0027s the behavior control seen in MLMs or the emotional manipulation in religious cults, Melody and Andrew equip listeners with critical thinking tools to recognize red flags. From love-bombing to guilt and fear tactics, they highlight the dangers of groups that demand unquestioning loyalty and isolate followers from the outside world. By the end of this episode, listeners will not only have a deeper understanding of what defines a cult but will also be armed with knowledge to spot cult-like manipulation in everyday life. Key Discussion Points: Defining cults: Moving beyond stereotypes of religious zealots. The BITE Model: Understanding how high-control groups manipulate behavior, thoughts, and emotions. How MLMs mirror cult-like structures and the dangers of wellness movements. Real-life examples from former cult members featured on Cultimatum.

      "description": "Ep. #33: Escaping The Chains \u2013 Suzanne Accardo\u0027s Journey from Trafficking Survivor to Advocate\nIn this powerful episode, we sit down with Suzanne Accardo, a human trafficking survivor and the founder of the Facebook group Modern Day Slavery, Creating Awareness about Human Trafficking in the USA. Suzanne begins by challenging a common misconception: that slavery was ever truly abolished. As a single mom to a 9-year-old boy, Suzanne shares her deeply personal story, which began when her mother married into a secretive \u0022brotherhood\u0022 in Montgomery County, Texas.\nSuzanne opens up about the horrifying experiences she endured, beginning at age 13 when she was molested by a man involved in organized crime, who married her mother. She shares the chilling belief that both her uncle and grandmother may have been poisoned, and how she was manipulated and slowly drugged while in a fake relationship with her trafficker. Her ordeal escalated to the point where she was chained in an RV for months, forced to live in a drug-induced haze, unsure of what she was being given.\nA moment of clarity came when she saw a video of herself, realizing the extent of her situation. She seized a rare opportunity to escape when her captor left the chains off and the door unlocked. But the nightmare was far from over. Suzanne was treated as a criminal, even being committed to a mental hospital when she should have been recognized as a victim.\nSuzanne\u2019s fight for survival continues today, as she raises awareness of the dangers of human trafficking and the systems that fail its victims. She discusses how her home has been broken into, her pets killed, and the ongoing fear for her life. Suzanne\u2019s advice to those targeted: never be alone and surround yourself with trusted people. Her story is one of survival, resilience, and a determined mission to expose the truth behind modern-day slavery in America.\nDon\u2019t miss this eye-opening episode of Cultimatum as Suzanne reveals the shocking realities of human trafficking and the resilience of the human spirit.\nLink to Suzanne\u0027s Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1456062254920275\n\nCultimatum Podcast Contact Info:\nEmail: cultimatumpodcast@gmail.com\nCultimatum Facebook Group:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1910498486077283\nCultimatum Instagram page:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/cultimatumpodcast?igsh=MXBnNXllYjBtc2hwcg==\nCultimatum TikTok account :\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@cultimatumpodcast?_t=8nLKfZ8ShnW\u0026_r=1\nCultimatum Pinterest account :\nhttps://pin.it/YdcAW0Oiq\nCult Escape \u0026 Recovery Support Group:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2575419069406501\nTo contact the Anonymous Andrew Podcast Studios\nanonymousandrewpodcast@gmail.com\nor visit\nwww.anonymousandrewpodcast.com",

      "description": "Ep. #32 Swindled By Faith with Richard Kiers In this episode, we delve into the harrowing journey of Richard Kier, who grew up in a little-known but insidious cult called The Move of God, founded by Sam Fife in the 1960s. The Move, an offshoot of the Baptist church, gained traction for its charismatic leader and promise of discovering the \u0022truth.\u0022 Richard\u2019s father, in his search for spiritual fulfillment, uprooted their family to join a communal farm in Canada when Richard was just 10 years old. Life in The Move was one of strict control and isolation. Members were required to sever ties with extended family, and every aspect of their lives was dictated by the cult\u2019s teachings\u2014down to the clothes they wore and how they groomed themselves. The commune prided itself on self-sufficiency, but this came with significant hardships. Living without running water, electricity, or proper sanitation, members hauled water from a nearby spring and used outhouses. The cabins they lived in were built by the community, and while some members had access to money and cars, these were communal property, used solely for the benefit of the group. As Richard grew older, he began to see the cracks in the cult\u2019s fa\u00E7ade, especially when his father fell ill. Despite his father\u2019s suffering, the group refused to seek outside medical help, insisting that any failure to recover was a result of weak faith. This incident deeply shook Richard\u2019s belief in the group. Life in the commune was harsh, with children put to work on the farm and forced to contribute to building the community. The food was scarce and of poor quality, and the environment was far from nurturing. Years later, Richard penned a book titled Swindled by Faith, chronicling his experiences. He waited until after his parents passed away to publish the book, out of respect for their memory, despite the pain they endured within the group. As his parents aged and became less useful to the cult, they were discarded\u2014no longer of value without money or income. In closing, Richard offers a poignant piece of advice for those questioning whether a group might be a cult or dangerous: observe how they treat the children. It is a revealing indicator of the group\u2019s true nature.

      "description": "Episode #31 Justine For Justice - Escaping the ICOC\nIn this episode, we hear from Justine, a survivor of the International Church of Christ (ICOC), as she bravely shares her experience of growing up in a controlling religious group. The ICOC is known for its extreme control over members, including enforcing a strict purity culture and dictating every aspect of members\u0027 lives.\nJustine\u0027s story is one of resilience and survival. At age 16, she left the group to seek treatment for an eating disorder, which marked the beginning of her journey to recovery and freedom. Now, 20 years later, Justine is thriving\u2014she\u2019s married and has three children. Her journey to healing began when she started a blog, sharing her experiences and helping others come forward with their own stories.\nThe ICOC\u0027s influence extended far beyond spiritual matters, impacting every aspect of Justine\u0027s life. Members were required to make significant financial contributions and were often given recruitment quotas, effectively turning them into unpaid laborers. Justine\u2019s family joined the ICOC when she was just three years old, seeking a supportive environment after her father\u2019s struggles with alcoholism. However, the reality was far from what they expected. Justine endured multiple forms of abuse and struggled with isolation, believing that everyone outside the group was doomed.\nThe turning point came when Justine\u2019s family learned about the systemic abuses within the ICOC, which eventually led them to leave the group. Today, Justine is a vocal advocate for those harmed by controlling religious groups, using her platform to raise awareness about the dangers of cults and importance of mental health. Her story is a powerful reminder of the strength it takes to break free from such environments and the importance of supporting survivors.\nThis episode is a crucial listen for anyone seeking to understand the psychological impact of cults and the path to recovery for survivors\nJustine\u0027s Contact Info:\nJustine\u0027s website for details on cases: https://open.substack.com/pub/justicejustine\nJustine\u0027s Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/justineforjustice/\nJustine\u0027s TikTok account: https://www.tiktok.com/@justineforjustice\nFor Anyone Harmed By the ICOC contact : https://www.instagram.com/free2b_org/\nCultimatum Podcast Contact Info:\nEmail: cultimatumpodcast@gmail.com\nCultimatum Facebook Group:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1910498486077283\nCultimatum Instagram page:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/cultimatumpodcast?igsh=MXBnNXllYjBtc2hwcg==\nCultimatum TikTok account :\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@cultimatumpodcast?_t=8nLKfZ8ShnW\u0026_r=1",

Hailing from New Zealand, Natalie was born into a strict Baptist Pentecostal church. As the youngest in her family and a fervent believer, she was deeply influenced by extreme teachings about Satan. Her parents\u0027 separation at age 10 marked the beginning of significant changes in her life. At just 11, Natalie found herself leading the kids\u0027 church at a new congregation. However, her teenage years were marred by sexual abuse from a family friend, leading her to leave school at 16 to dedicate herself to the church with her mother\u2019s support. A pivotal turn came when her mother met two women from Namibia and decided to sell their home and move to Africa, bringing Natalie along. Upon arrival, they quickly noticed unsettling red flags. The cult had Pentecostal roots, but the son of the leading family was revered as the second coming of Christ, with leaders dressing in robes and sandals to mimic biblical times. Despite the oppressive environment, Natalie\u2019s mother managed to escape first, and Natalie followed soon after, executing a carefully planned escape under dire circumstances. Back in New Zealand, Natalie returned to a Pentecostal church and got married, only to face immense pressure to have children despite infertility struggles. This led to severe panic attacks and ultimately her departure from the church. Seeking belonging, she joined the Mormon church with her family, only to leave a few years later due to its negative impact on her children and her need to constantly unteach them doctrines she disagreed with. Now, ten years out, Natalie has dedicated herself to deconstructing and reconstructing her beliefs. Her story is a testament to resilience and critical thinking. She offers powerful advice to our audience: trust your instincts and always employ critical thinking skills. Tune in to hear Natalie\u2019s unique and inspirational story of survival, recovery, and the quest for personal truth.

      "description": "Episode #29: The Amazing Adventures of an Amish Stripper with Naomi Swartzentruber Join us on Cultimatium as we uncover the compelling journey of Naomi Swartzentruber, who was born into the strict Swartzentruber Amish community in mid-Michigan. Naomi shares her harrowing and inspiring story of growing up in a sheltered environment, one she now identifies as a cult. Despite her past, Naomi continues to wear Amish dress on her social media accounts and has authored a provocative memoir, The Amazing Adventures of an Amish Stripper: An Erotic Memoir. Naomi\u2019s quest for freedom began when she befriended a \u0022worldly\u0022 neighbor girl, sparking her curiosity about the outside world. This curiosity led her to run away at 17, aided by an \u201CEnglish\u201D man who exploited and manipulated her. This marked the start of her tumultuous journey, which saw her become a stripper at 20, struggle with severe drug addiction, and ultimately resort to prostitution. Now, 27 years removed from her Amish upbringing, Naomi is clean, in a stable relationship, and a proud mother to a 3-year-old daughter, living peacefully in Arizona. She has found the freedom she always dreamed of\u2014not just from the Amish community, but also from a life of addiction and exploitation. Naomi\u2019s story is a testament to resilience, offering a powerful message of hope, perseverance, and the courage to create a better life. Tune in to hear Naomi\u0027s candid account of her transformation, her reflections on the Amish lifestyle, and her journey to reclaim her autonomy and happiness. Her story is not only a vivid portrayal of escape and survival but also an inspiring call to never give up on your dreams.

Kim Peirano, a former member with eight years of experience, reveals the inner workings of this controversial organization. Despite their disclaimer, claiming they are not a cult, Kim\u2019s journey paints a stark picture of manipulation and control.\nKim ascended to level 9.5 in their 10-level program, with level 5 remaining top secret. Members are discouraged from discussing their progress, fostering an atmosphere of secrecy and division. With a membership of just over 100, Kim describes a culture where questioning the group\u2019s practices is not permitted, and hypnosis techniques are commonly used.\nAs a Doctor of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine and a certified Hypnotherapist, Kim\u2019s story is compelling. She details how members are bombarded with love bombing, making them feel exceptionally special, while charismatic leaders Dana and Eric, the second-in-command, maintain strict control. Members are expected to donate time, volunteer for various projects, and engage in expensive classes and retreats. The group\u2019s teachings incorporate elements of Scientology, employing mind control techniques and the notorious mirroring exercise to manipulate and silence dissent.\nKim also discusses the group\u2019s impact on her personal life and business post-exit. She explores the notion that cults provide meaning and fill voids, a lure that kept her ensnared for years.

In this special editorial episode, we address the removal of a episode #4 at the request of a guest who courageously shared her story with us. Unfortunately, after the episode aired, she was subjected to severe intimidation and threats from the very cult she sought to expose. We stand in solidarity with her decision, recognizing the manipulative tactics and bullying behaviors these groups employ to silence truth and instill fear. This episode is a reflection on the power these organizations still wield, the importance of protecting those who speak out, and a commitment to continue shining a light on the darkness of cults. While this episode no longer remains in our archive, the conversation about the dangers of these groups is far from over.

      "description": "Episode #27: Breaking the Silence: Elizabeth Quiroz\u2019s Brave Journey as Our First Human Trafficking Survivor In this powerful episode, we are honored to have Elizabeth Quiroz, our first human trafficking survivor, sharing her story to bring hope and awareness to others. Elizabeth\u2019s journey began with multiple types of abuse starting at just four years old. Due to the trauma, she sought love, acceptance, and attention from others, she eventually ended up in the foster care system. At 15, she moved in with her alcoholic father. Elizabeth highlights the red flags of human trafficking: not coming home at night, associating with older men, and avoiding eye contact by looking down. Elizabeth\u2019s vulnerability was exploited by a boyfriend who groomed her and introduced her to drugs, leading her to become a drug mule. She explains that traffickers can be anyone, including women who pose as friends. Her second trafficker, a woman she trusted, further manipulated her. Elizabeth\u2019s addiction to drugs led to repeated incarcerations and being labor trafficked by a drug dealer. Her life took a turn when she became pregnant; she got sober after giving birth, earned her GED in prison, and went into rehab after her release. Now an author and a social worker with a master\u2019s in social justice and human rights, Elizabeth has written a book titled Purified in the Flame, available on Amazon. She is also the co-founder of Redemption House Bay Area in California. In this episode, Elizabeth explains some of the terms and vocabulary used in the human trafficking world and points out ways the system could improve to prevent more victims, such as implementing background checks and educating foster parents. We are immensely grateful to Elizabeth for sharing her story with us and shedding light on this critical issue.

      "description": "Episode #26: Breaking Free: Eleanor Skelton\u0027s Journey from Independent Fundamentalist Baptist (IFB) to Liberation\nIn this episode, we delve into the life and experiences of Eleanor Skelton, who grew up in the Independent Fundamentalist Baptist (IFB) movement. Eleanor, the oldest in her family, was first part of the Westwood Bible Church in Bouemount, Texas. Initially, she had a relatively normal church experience there. However, her family moved frequently between Texas and Colorado throughout her childhood.\nTheir first encounter with the IFB church was when they relocated to Colorado Springs. The environment in the IFB church was marked by intense mind control and an extreme intolerance for those who did not share the same religious or political views.\nEleanor was homeschooled for many years before attending college. Concerned that she was becoming too influenced by the outside world, her parents gave her an ultimatum: transfer to Bob Jones University, an institution known for its stringent and extreme orthodox teachings and rules, or face the consequences. This ultimatum became a pivotal moment for Eleanor. She chose not to attend Bob Jones University. As a result, her parents not only stopped paying for her education but also shunned her. Her younger siblings were forbidden from having any contact with her.\nToday, Eleanor is on a journey of recovery from religious trauma and an eating disorder. She continues to receive therapy and is making significant strides in her healing process. Articulate and well-adjusted, Eleanor shared her story with us, and it was a pleasure having her on the show.\n\nEleanor\u0027s Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC53ELsLgDAEqYn8ZmisMmWA\nEleanor\u0027s Blog : https://eleanorskelton.com/2015/01/09/whyileft-fundamentalism-part-1/\nVashti Initiative (ex-cult resource): https://vashtiinitiative.org/\nCultimatum Contact Info:\nPodcast Contact info:\nEmail: cultimatumpodcast@gmail.com\nCultimatum Facebook Group:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1910498486077283\nCultimatum Instagram page:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/cultimatumpodcast?igsh=MXBnNXllYjBtc2hwcg==\nCultimatum TikTok account :\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@cultimatumpodcast?_t=8nLKfZ8ShnW\u0026_r=1\nCultimatum Pinterest account :\nhttps://pin.it/YdcAW0Oiq\nCult Escape \u0026 Recovery Support Group:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2575419069406501\nTo contact the Anonymous Andrew Podcast Studios\nanonymousandrewpodcast@gmail.com\nor visit\nwww.anonymousandrewpodcast.com",

Karl served as a pastor in several Baptist churches over a span of 20 years, while Laura played the role of the supportive pastor\u0027s wife, raising their children and contributing to the church community.\nAfter two decades of ministry, Karl \u0026 Laura began to reevaluate their beliefs, embarking on a journey of healing from the spiritual damage they had endured. Through therapy and other healing methods, they have worked hard to mend the wounds inflicted by their past. \nDuring their time in one small Texas town, they encountered a pre-existing hierarchy that controlled not only the church but also the town itself. This power structure tested their resolve and made it clear who was truly in charge.\nKarl \u0026 Laura have channeled their experiences into their writing, authoring several books together. Their latest work, \u0022Evolving From Religious Trauma,\u0022 delves into their journey of recovery and offers insights for others seeking to heal from similar experiences.\nJoin us for a candid conversation with Karl and Laura Forehand as they share their story of transformation, resilience, and hope.\nKarl \u0026 Laura\u0027s website: https://thedesertsanctuary.org/\nKarl \u0026 Laura\u0027s 2nd website: https://thedesertsanctuary.org/treasure-trove/\nLink to Karl \u0026 Laura\u0027s First book together: https://www.amazon.com/Out-Into-Desert-Thriving-Organized/dp/1957007230\nLink to Karl \u0026 Laura\u0027s Latest Book: https://www.amazon.com/Evolving-Religious-Trauma-Karl-Forehand-ebook/dp/B0CWMJWY48/\nKarl \u0026 Laura\u0027s Podcast : https://open.spotify.com/show/1w6r6hGlE8aSBZXaNoOw0P?si=sDKGS1hpQFmG3BuLix6A2g\nCultimatum Contact Info:\nEmail: cultimatumpodcast@gmail.com\nCultimatum Facebook Group:https://www.facebook.com/groups/1910498486077283\nCultimatum Instagram page:https://www.instagram.com/cultimatumpodcast?igsh=MXBnNXllYjBtc2hwcg==\nCultimatum TikTok account :https://www.tiktok.com/@cultimatumpodcast?_t=8nLKfZ8ShnW\u0026_r=1\nCult Escape \u0026 Recovery Support Group:https://www.facebook.com/groups/2575419069406501\nTo contact the Anonymous Andrew Podcast Studios\nanonymousandrewpodcast@gmail.com",

Born into the faith, Karinne was the youngest in her family and often seen as the \u0022black sheep.\u0022 From the tender age of five, she endured abuse from church members, only to be dismissed and disbelieved by her mother and the congregation when she bravely spoke out.\nKarinne\u0027s adolescence was turbulent, marked by multiple departures from and returns to the group, each time accompanied by the harsh reality of being disfellowshipped. Ultimately, her breaking point came when faced with the organization\u0027s teaching that she must choose death over allowing her child to receive a life-saving blood transfusion. This heart-wrenching directive propelled Karinne to leave the faith for good, prioritizing the safety and protection of her child.\nDespite the hardships, Karinne ends her interview on a hopeful note, offering words of encouragement to others who have left the organization and are struggling to find their place in the world.

Influenced by TFU\u0027s teachings, Danielle engaged in stalking behavior and failed to respect boundaries, leading to her spending 20 days in jail. Remarkably, Danielle has only been out of the cult for three weeks.\nShe candidly discusses how her jail time helped her detox from TFU\u0027s influence. Believing she had found her twin flame, Danielle was willing to go to any lengths, even to her own detriment. Her release from jail came with the condition from a family member that she must completely sever ties with TFU.\nDanielle has since been attending church and offers forgiveness to the person who was responsible for her incarceration. She is hopeful for leniency from the courts and is hoping that her public defense, will be able to explain her connection with TFU \u0026 shed light on her extreme and unusual behaviors that led to six restraining orders.\nShe emphasizes that TFU is a religious-based cult, frequently referencing God but not using the Bible. Currently, Danielle is receiving therapy and support as she transitions out of TFU.\nDanielle\u0027s final message to anyone involved with TFU or similar groups is urgent: \u0022GET OUT as soon as you can before it causes the kind of permanent damage that I am dealing with in my own life.\u0022\nTune in to Cultimatum to hear the rest of Danielle\u2019s compelling journey and gain deeper insights into the profound impacts cults can have on individuals.\n\nDanielle\u0027s TikTok Link: https://www.tiktok.com/@itsjustdanii003?lang=en\nCultimatum Contact Info:\nPodcast Contact info:\nEmail: cultimatumpodcast@gmail.com\nCultimatum Facebook Group:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1910498486077283\nCultimatum Instagram page:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/cultimatumpodcast?igsh=MXBnNXllYjBtc2hwcg==\nCultimatum TikTok account :\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@cultimatumpodcast?_t=8nLKfZ8ShnW\u0026_r=1\nCultimatum Pinterest account :\nhttps://pin.it/YdcAW0Oiq\nCult Escape \u0026 Recovery Support Group:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2575419069406501\nTo contact the Anonymous Andrew Podcast Studios\nanonymousandrewpodcast@gmail.com\nor visit\nwww.anonymousandrewpodcast.com",

Danielle\u0027s journey with the concept of a twin flame began in elementary school. However, it wasn\u0027t until later in life that she revisited this idea, eventually discovering TFU on YouTube around 2015. It wasn\u0027t until she became an adult in 2022 that she officially joined the group.\nDanielle delves into the techniques used by TFU, including MAP (Mind Alignment Process) and the mirror exercise. She shares how these methods began to severely impact her mental health, leading to self-harm. Danielle opens up about how her involvement with the group affected her relationships, family connections, and finances.\nAt its peak, TFU had around 25,000 followers, but following the release of documentaries about the group, its popularity surged to approximately 50,000 members. Ironically, the documentaries intended to expose TFU ended up promoting it, drawing more people in.\nWe conclude this episode with Danielle recounting how she ultimately ended up in jail due to TFU\u0027s teachings.

      "description": "Episode #21: Interview with Nick Johnson - Life Inside the Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ In Episode #21, we delve into the compelling and complex story of Nick Johnson, a former member of the Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ. Nick\u0027s journey into the cult began at the young age of 20, introduced by a neighbor. The group, which aligns with the beliefs of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement, strategically targets young individuals to draw them into its fold. The leader during most of Nick\u0027s tenure was Jermaine Grant, who later faced charges for church-related financial schemes. Although Grant pleaded guilty, he passed away from COVID-19 before sentencing. Throughout his time in the church, Nick devoted countless hours to \u0022volunteering\u0022 in various capacities, often at the expense of his family life. The rigorous demands left him with barely enough time to sleep, adhering to the leader\u2019s directive that four hours of sleep per night was optimal. The Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ has numerous locations in major cities along the East Coast of the U.S. Nick provides a detailed account of the church\u0027s doctrines, the profound impact on his personal and family life, and the internal dynamics that shaped his experience. In this episode, Nick also shares his current beliefs and how he has rebuilt his life post-cult. His story is a powerful testament to his resilience. Tune in as Nick Johnson reveals the intricacies of life within the Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ, offering a rare and enlightening perspective on the challenges faced by those entangled in and eventually breaking free from cultic control.

      "description": "Episode #20: Interview with Judith Castillo - Life After La Luz Del Mundo Judith, a former member of the controversial religious group La Luz Del Mundo. Despite her family\u0027s deep devotion and dedication, she faced many personal challenges within the organization, which has its headquarters in Guadalajara, Mexico, and branches worldwide, including many across the US. During her early teens, she encountered the grandson of the church\u0027s leader. A coercive indiscretion with him led to a forced marriage, accompanied by severe punishment from the church for their so-called sin. Her breaking point came when she discovered that her daughter had been a victim of abuse by another church member. This revelation drove Judith to leave the church and start speaking out against the abuses perpetuated by the organization. She began protesting in front of the church, demanding justice for herself, her daughter, and others who suffered similar fates. Join us as Judith Castillo shares her powerful story of endurance, courage, and advocacy. Her narrative not only exposes the dark underbelly of La Luz Del Mundo but also highlights the indomitable human spirit\u0027s capacity for healing and fighting for justice.

Lucia\u0027s story is one of repeated attempts to break free, only to be pulled back into the grips of the organization throughout her life.\nLucia shares her painful experiences, including childhood abuse by a family member. Tragically, when she sought help, both her parents and the church sided with her abuser, branding her a liar. This led to tumultuous teenage years where she found herself isolated and unsupported.\nIn an attempt to escape her dire situation, Lucia married at just 17, only to find herself in another controlling and abusive relationship. Throughout these struggles, Lucia also endured years of mistreatment by her mentally ill mother before finally leaving her oppressive environment.\nJoin us as we explore Lucia\u0027s incredible story of resilience and recovery. This episode is not just a testament to her strength but also a beacon of hope for anyone struggling to find light after the darkness of cultic control.\nLucia\u0027s website : https://luciamuirbooks.wordpress.com/counsellor/\nLucia\u0027s Facebook page : https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100093150242973\nLucia\u0027s book on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Let-Your-Light-Shine-Secrets/dp/B0C4ZXGP1Y/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1XFRAXRLFM5GP\u0026dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ird-5HtsL_FffyNarkiHABRYlaNjKmWZvUUqa4LpVOg.VU4yn5uQsHVoWWfEy8osvKw5hAUQTW4bWqnDgca4F3c\u0026dib_tag=se\u0026keywords=let\u002Byour\u002Blight\u002Bshine\u002Blucia\u002Bmuir\u0026qid=1717867829\u0026sprefix=let\u002Byou\u002Blight\u002Bshine\u002Blucia%2Caps%2C302\u0026sr=8-1\nCultimatum Contact Info:\nEmail: cultimatumpodcast@gmail.com\nCultimatum Facebook Group:https://www.facebook.com/groups/1910498486077283\nCultimatum Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/cultimatumpodcast?igsh=MXBnNXllYjBtc2hwcg==\nCultimatum TikTok account : https://www.tiktok.com/@cultimatumpodcast?_t=8nLKfZ8ShnW\u0026_r=1\nCultimatum Pinterest account :https://pin.it/YdcAW0Oiq\nCult Escape \u0026 Recovery Support Group:https://www.facebook.com/groups/2575419069406501\nTo contact the Anonymous Andrew Podcast Studios\nanonymousandrewpodcast@gmail.com\nor visit\nwww.anonymousandrewpodcast.com",

Below is the original description! Even the cover art is the original! EP#34 On this episode, we chat with a woman who rented a \u0022room\u0022 to Jeff \u0026 Shaleia back in 2016. At that time they were nobody. (Ok maybe still are?) At the time she had no idea who they were to become. This took place in Michigan (where they are based) but of course they hadn\u0027t started TFU yet. They were just two wandering nomads (double entendre) going from motel to house to car and in circles. You have got to hear this story. A great peak into the mindset of Jeff, possibly the most disturbed individual of our modern times. (Ok maybe some political figures and leaders of nations take that cake) But you can really get a picture of his goal to be a dominant figure in his demented world! I need more stories like this, so if you knew either of them prior to TFU please contact me. Of course you can be anonymous. After all this is the Anonymous Andrew Podcast!

Many, if not all are traumatized and their lives are changed forever. Once out, they face the challenge of putting their lives back together. But these challenges that lie ahead of them are unimaginable. Anonymous Andrew from the Anonymous Andrew Podcast is joined my Melody, an ex-member of a cult herself to co-host this show. We hope this show brings awareness to the fact that cults around the US and worldwide are very much alive and thriving and preying on so many vulnerable people. We hope to also bring hope to this who might still be in a cult or being trafficked that there is hope and life on the other side! Melody and I (Anonymous Andrew) begin our journey on investigating cults from around the world and right here in the USA. It is amazing how many there are and how they get away with so much debauchery. Joins us as we expose these cults with ex-members and survivors who tell their story! You are not alone!
