      "description": "In 1989, at the age of 22, Alexandra Amor moved to Vancouver, BC and joined what she thought was a meditation class. Ten years later, she escaped what she describes as having become a mind control cult run by a self-serving guru.\r\n\r\n Leaving behind all her friends, her spiritual community, her sense of self, and the man she loved, Alexandra moved out into the world searching for healing, and to understand what had happened to her.\r\n\r\n \u201CCult, A Love Story\u201D is the Amazon best-selling, award-winning memoir that shows by example how we are drawn into high-demand (cultic) groups. And what recovery from that experience looks like. \r\n\r\n For me, this is one of those books that is helpful from every angle as Alexandra so beautifully writes about her experience and then gives us the bonus of seamlessly weaving it into her own learning about these patterns typically found  in cultic groups and controlling leaders. I highly recommend this book for families and friends with a loved one in such a situation as well as those who have left such groups and want a really well written memoir that also serves to educate.\r\n\r\n To learn more about Alexandra Amor and her career as a novelist and podcast host, please visit her website at: https://alexandraamor.com/ Check out \u0022It\u2019s a mystery podcast\u0022: https://alexandraamor.com/podcast-its-a-mystery/\r\n\r\n Jennifer is a mental health counselor located in the Los Angeles area, using Internal Family Systems (IFS) as the primary modality of psychotherapy that she uses with clients.

      "description": "In 2004, Ryan Hernandez joined a Catholic religious community to live a life of prayer, education, and charity. He was just 17 at the time that he left his life in Los Angeles to follow \u0022The Call\u0022 and to follow Christ. Many years later, he would refer to this Catholic sect as an End Times Cult. While in the group he had been a devoted follower and loyal member but there was also abuse and brainwashing taking place and it was this abuse and growing shame that became an unbearable burden for him to bear. After years of bullying, physical abuse, humiliation, psychological abuse, and even solitary confinement, Ryan decided to leave the community. Outside of the cult, Ryan found that his mind was still under their influence and negativity. After years of being brainwashed that life outside of the community would mean being cursed by God Ryan found himself in deep depression, loneliness, and shame. With the help of some true friends and a supportive family, Ryan was able to find the healing that he needed and to free himself from the cultic influences that had entrapped him. Ryan is now working to bring awareness to cult abuse and other important issues through his project called \u0022The Truth That Heals Podcast\u0022. It is available on major podcast platforms.

      "description": "In 2004, Ryan Hernandez joined a Catholic religious community to live a life of prayer, education, and charity. He was just 17 at the time that he left his life in Los Angeles to follow \u0022The Call\u0022 and to follow Christ. Many years later, he would refer to this Catholic sect as an End Times Cult. While in the group he had been a devoted follower and loyal member but there was also abuse and brainwashing taking place and it was this abuse and growing shame that became an unbearable burden for him to bear. After years of bullying, physical abuse, humiliation, psychological abuse, and even solitary confinement, Ryan decided to leave the community. Outside of the cult, Ryan found that his mind was still under their influence and negativity. After years of being brainwashed that life outside of the community would mean being cursed by God Ryan found himself in deep depression, loneliness, and shame. With the help of some true friends and a supportive family, Ryan was able to find the healing that he needed and to free himself from the cultic influences that had entrapped him. Ryan is now working to bring awareness to cult abuse and other important issues through his project called \u0022The Truth That Heals Podcast\u0022. It is available on major podcast platforms.

Afterwards, she researched, obsessively, and recognized \u201Cschool\u201D as a cult. She posted a blog. Soon, Cult Confessions, a CD of ten original songs, followed.  Every time she spoke or sang out, she felt calmer and clearer. She started an \u201Cedu-tainment campaign\u201D presenting her misadventure to private audiences.\u00A0 Releasing secrets freed her voice and mind. The Gentle Soul personality profile and a mission to empower other empaths unfolded.

      "description": " Esther Friedman is a licensed mental health counselor, expressive art therapist, songwriter, author, and ex-cult member.\u00A0In 2006, a \u201Cnew friend\u201D introduced her to an \u0022esoteric school.\u0022 In 2011, she left a secret cult. Afterwards, she researched, obsessively, and recognized \u201Cschool\u201D as a cult. She posted a blog. Soon, Cult Confessions, a CD of ten original songs, followed.  Every time she spoke or sang out, she felt calmer and clearer. She started an \u201Cedu-tainment campaign\u201D presenting her misadventure to private audiences.\u00A0 Releasing secrets freed her voice and mind. The Gentle Soul personality profile and a mission to empower other empaths unfolded. She published, The Gentle Souls Revolution, a memoir, a public service announcement, and recovery guide and template to help Gentle Souls navigate exploitative relationships.\u00A0  Today, her story and songs are weaving together into a mini-musical.

      "description": "Anke Richter is a columnist and reporter. Her investigative and personal features have\u00A0been published in Die Zeit, Spiegel, FAZ, taz, New Zealand Geographic, North \u0026 South, The Spinoff, Canvas and others. Her most recent and fourth book is called, Cult Trip. Inside the World of Coercion \u0026 Control.  In Part 1 of this 3 Part interview we primarily cover the subject matter of Centrepoint. Part 2 has a focus on the neo-Tantric community of Agama. Part 3 is primarily a discussion about Gloriavale.  Cult Trip is described as \u201Ca leading journalist\u2019s personal, intense and riveting\u00A0investigation into the worlds of cults.  At a new age festival in Byron Bay, Australia, German journalist Anke Richter is finding her spiritual awakening when she meets a woman (a survivor of the Centrepoint cult) who will change the course of her life and career. Over the next ten years, Anke pursued a labyrinthine investigation into how and why cults attract, entrap and destroy otherwise ordinary people, asking what the line is between tribe and cult, participant and perpetrator, seduction and sexual abuse.  From the emotional and criminal carnage of Centrepoint in Auckland, New Zealand, to an anti-cult conference in Manchester, the infamous Osho\u2019s ashram in India, the tantric Agama Yoga school in remote Thailand and culminating in a visit to Gloriavale on the west coast of New Zealand\u2019s South Island, Anke uncovers a disturbing pattern of violence and suffering.  International bestseller Cult Trip is a powerful exploration of what really goes on inside the groups we call cults, and how to reckon with their aftermath.\u201D  I am so grateful for Anke\u2019s body of work raising awareness for cult survivors and also her advocacy to protect the public and educate about these abusive groups.  Please listen with care as these episodes deal with the subject matters of sexual abuse \u0026 child abuse. \u201CCult Trip.

      "description": "Anke Richter is a columnist and reporter. Her investigative and personal features have\u00A0been published in Die Zeit, Spiegel, FAZ, taz, New Zealand Geographic, North \u0026 South, The Spinoff, Canvas and others. Her most recent and fourth book is called, Cult Trip. Inside the World of Coercion \u0026 Control.  In Part 1 of this 3 Part interview we primarily cover the subject matter of Centrepoint. Part 2 has a focus on the neo-Tantric community of Agama. Part 3 is primarily a discussion about Gloriavale.  Cult Trip is described as \u201Ca leading journalist\u2019s personal, intense and riveting\u00A0investigation into the worlds of cults.  At a new age festival in Byron Bay, Australia, German journalist Anke Richter is finding her spiritual awakening when she meets a woman (a survivor of the Centrepoint cult) who will change the course of her life and career. Over the next ten years, Anke pursued a labyrinthine investigation into how and why cults attract, entrap and destroy otherwise ordinary people, asking what the line is between tribe and cult, participant and perpetrator, seduction and sexual abuse.  From the emotional and criminal carnage of Centrepoint in Auckland, New Zealand, to an anti-cult conference in Manchester, the infamous Osho\u2019s ashram in India, the tantric Agama Yoga school in remote Thailand and culminating in a visit to Gloriavale on the west coast of New Zealand\u2019s South Island, Anke uncovers a disturbing pattern of violence and suffering.  International bestseller Cult Trip is a powerful exploration of what really goes on inside the groups we call cults, and how to reckon with their aftermath.\u201D  I am so grateful for Anke\u2019s body of work raising awareness for cult survivors and also her advocacy to protect the public and educate about these abusive groups.

      "description": " Marc-Henri Sandoz Paradella is a writer, mentor, therapist, theologian, and teacher of meditation and tarot. He graduated in theology from the University of Geneva in 1987 and was a pastor for fifteen years. Then he radically reoriented his life. Years later, he fully realized and dealt with the toxic dynamics that had been imprinted within him by his upbringing and religious commitment. He now dedicates most of his time to writing, individual counseling, teaching meditation, yoga nidra, and tarot.  Toxic Jesus is a thought-provoking book rooted in the author\u2019s deep personal experience. It shows how every religion can become toxic and promote shame, guilt and repression. It exposes how the poison of toxic spirituality hides behind religious fa\u00E7ades and affects every person exposed to it. Finally, it guides you through the path of recovering from the damages caused by toxic spirituality.    Click here to purchase Toxic Jesus. My Journey from Holy Shit to Spiritual Healing.

      "description": " When Erika Bornman was nine years old, her family joined and ultimately moved to, KwaSizabantu, a Christian mission in South Africa\u2014a place touted as a multiracial nirvana, founded on egalitarian values. But life at KwaSizabantu was hard, especially because Christianity was used to justify harsh punishments and physical abuse. KwaSizabantu exerted emotional, psychological, and sexual control over her, until, finally, she escaped at the age of 21. Escaping a restrictive religious community is difficult, but rehabilitation into \u2018normal\u2019 life after a decade of ritual humiliation, brainwashing, and abuse was much more painful. Erika could not ignore her knowledge of the grievous human-rights abuses being committed at KwaSizabantu, and so she embarked on a quest to expose the atrocities. With her help, News24 launched a seven-month investigation, culminating in a podcast that would go on to win the internationally renowned One World Media Award for Radio and Podcast in 2021. In Mission of Malice: My Exodus from KwaSizabantu, Erika chronicles her journey from a fearful young girl to a fierce activist determined to do whatever it takes to save future generations and find personal redemption and self-acceptance. Erika has also carved a career for herself in magazine publishing as a writer and editor. Mission of Malice, her memoir, is her first book and an important element in her quest to make the world a safer place for children. She lives in Cape Town, South Africa, with her two cats.

      "description": " When Erika Bornman was nine years old, her family joined and ultimately moved to, KwaSizabantu, a Christian mission in South Africa\u2014a place touted as a multiracial nirvana, founded on egalitarian values. But life at KwaSizabantu was hard, especially because Christianity was used to justify harsh punishments and physical abuse. KwaSizabantu exerted emotional, psychological, and sexual control over her, until, finally, she escaped at the age of 21. Escaping a restrictive religious community is difficult, but rehabilitation into \u2018normal\u2019 life after a decade of ritual humiliation, brainwashing, and abuse was much more painful. Erika could not ignore her knowledge of the grievous human-rights abuses being committed at KwaSizabantu, and so she embarked on a quest to expose the atrocities. With her help, News24 launched a seven-month investigation, culminating in a podcast that would go on to win the internationally renowned One World Media Award for Radio and Podcast in 2021. In Mission of Malice: My Exodus from KwaSizabantu, Erika chronicles her journey from a fearful young girl to a fierce activist determined to do whatever it takes to save future generations and find personal redemption and self-acceptance. Erika has also carved a career for herself in magazine publishing as a writer and editor. Mission of Malice, her memoir, is her first book and an important element in her quest to make the world a safer place for children. She lives in Cape Town, South Africa, with her two cats. This podcast contains explicit content as well as sexual abuse and child abuse trigger warning.

She is exposing the cultic environment of her former Church known as Revival for Christ Club in Moore, Oklahoma. This group also owns and operates the Yellow Rose Dinner theater. The leader of the group is Timothy Vanover, accompanied by his wife, Jennifer Vanover.\u00A0 Amanda shares her experience regarding what it was like growing up in this group, and the impact it\u2019s had on her family. After 35 years she has decided to speak out after losing her mother and being distanced from her eldest daughter. Although her story carries pain, Amanda has found new purpose as she fights to expose the group, the leadership, the destruction of families, and religious abuse.

TW: adult \u0026 child abuse \u0026 sexual abuse Lou infused his version of biblical teachings with pseudo-psycho beliefs, constantly creating new \u201Ctherapies\u201D to \u201Cdeal with the personal, family and sexual\u201D problems he identified within his parishioners. In 1976, Lou began teaching that \u201Csex is a myth in our culture\u201D and developed bizarre therapies to prove his theory. At 14, against Deb\u2019s will, she was involved in several of the therapies. Knowing she wasn\u2019t supposed to talk about what she had experienced, she also knew it wasn\u2019t right, and told someone. The media got hold of the information and started bombarding Lou for interviews. When the church found out, they decided to take action and hold him accountable. On March 21, 1977, Lou submitted his resignation to the Methodist church to avoid a heresy trial. Lou and several of his devoted followers decided to create their own community, and eventually purchased a 58-acre plot of land on Vashon Island in Washington State where they lived in big green army tents for years while the community built homes, and a couple buildings. They called themselves The Wesleyan Community, officially called, The Wesleyan Christian Community Church and Retreat Center. Deb shares the story of her time in Ingleside and on Vashon Island until she eventually escaped in February of 1981, when she was 19 years old.

      "description": "Melissa was raised in a conservative, cult-like faction of the fundamentalist Seventh-Day Adventist Church.\u00A0 She left the church when she turned 18 and it was the late 80\u2019s. At the time, she was thinking she was out, done, through. Throwing herself into \u0022the real world\u0022 she modeled, acted, earned an Ivy League degree, worked in politics, finance, and high tech. She also married twice and had two children. In addition, she also did a lot of exploring of all that had been forbidden! And always...she wrote. In her 30\u2019s she found out that various male members of her family had been abusers within the church. This sent her on a decades-long discovery process: confronting family members and tracking down and speaking to the victims. She formed an unlikely bond with one of the victims, and this led her to uncover and address her own trauma from purity culture, the patriarchal stranglehold, and church abuse. The Glory Whole is the name of her instagram account which she refers to as \u201Ca work in progress that chronicles her story\u201D.

The group had a female leader who was based at their headquarters in England (Mansfield Woodhouse) and dictated much of the community\u2019s ongoings as well as individual lives, with the use of fear \u0026 high pressure tactics to interrogate and manipulate. After many years and as part of her own healing journey of discovery and exploration, Naomi and others are telling their stories through a podcast series that Naomi created, called Cult in Connecticut. In it, Naomi shares about her experience of being born and raised in this cult, and the journey of healing from the pain and confusion she experienced growing up. At eighteen, Naomi left the church and everything she had ever known to begin a new life. We discuss her process of leaving, healing, experiencing life and much more!

      "description": "Janice Selbie was born and raised in a charismatic Christian home, attending Pentecostal,\u00A0Vineyard, and other Evangelical churches before eventually marrying a man who would become a pastor. In her 30s she became ultraconservative, wearing a head-covering, homeschooling their children, and rejecting any vestiges of secular life ( including TV, radio, music, newspapers, magazines, etc.). \u201CI referred to myself as \u2018Mennocostal,\u2019 frequently attending closed Mennonite churches run by the Holdeman Mennonites.\u201D It wasn\u2019t until her 40s that Janice began experiencing doubts about her deeply held faith. As her marriage unraveled, her questions grew. She found herself wondering about the impact of religion on sexuality, gender roles and equality, social justice, and more.\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CNot permitted to explore these questions, I felt like a beach ball held beneath the water for too long. My sadness, confusion, and anger threatened to explode if something didn\u0027t change.\u201D \u00A0After ending her decades-long marriage, Janice went back to school to attain her Diploma of Applied Psychology and Counseling.\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CMy passion is to help others who are experiencing the multiple significant losses associated with religious de-conversion. My own journey could have been easier if I had been able to connect with even one other person who had walked away from their faith and built a healthy life afterward.\u201D\u00A0 \u00A0These painful experiences influenced Janice to develop the Divorcing Religion Workshop so that others could gain knowledge and tools to help with their own journey out of fundamentalist religions.\u00A0\u00A0 In May of 2021, Janice hosted the inaugural on-line \u0027Conference on Religious Trauma\u0027 (CORT), with over 20 speakers providing education \u0026 insight into RTS \u0026 recovery.

You can find her music here: https://www.witchwoodmusic.com/goldi Or via Instagram at: https://www.instagram.com/goldi.locke/ (music link in bio) In her podcast episode you will hear Gabrielle describe her experiences in the organization that began as the Order of Christ / Sophia and then morphed into 2 separate organizations run by each leader independently. We will join her as she describes this journey weaving in and out of relationship with these leaders and groups. When Gabrielle left the last group she was a part of, she wrote her first music single, \u201C7:30\u201D about the struggle of finding herself. In the song she says \u201CI want to know who I am\u201D and \u201Csometimes I don\u2019t feel right in my skin\u201D. This song is about the beginning of her liberation.

Debbie is not just a mother but also served as a United Methodist minister for 40 years. She is currently retired and lives in Bend, Oregon with her husband John. She enjoys spending time with her family, reading to children through the SMART reading program, as well as making quilts to give away. She is in the process of planning, together with John, as they build a net-zero house in Bend. It was such a pleasure to speak with Debbie and receive her story around the heartache and considerations that a parent specifically can experience when their child is in a group of high control / high demand. If you would like to hear her son, Joel Pitney speak to his experience, please refer to episode 11. Especially for those family members and friends with loved ones close to you heart who are in such groups, I hope you find that our discussion leaves you feeling not so alone.\u00A0 The below article that is an interview that Joel conducted with Debbie.

      "description": "Anna Fienbork was born in Austria, grew up and lived in Germany and the US, and is currently living in Bavaria. Her career has led her from studying Art History, to theatre, to studying again with a focus on education and working with the hearing impaired and children with special needs. What initially drew her to the group of high control that she became deeply involved with was the emotional-spiritual paradigm, that allowed her to take a deeper dive into working with inner parts, and further opening up spiritually. In that context she worked as an emotional facilitator in one on one sessions as well as in groups with both adults and children. She also gave seminars on the human psyche and how the structure of emotions can be explained within the paradigm of these teachings. During this time, Anna also learned emotional and energetic body work, helping others to release old patterns, in order to help people open up to their own potential. Anna is now a practicing psychotherapist (Heilpraktiker f\u00FCr Psychotherapie). She also does online work as a coach with her main focus on helping couples find their way from struggles and a sense of having lost one another to healing communication and fulfilling closeness. Her passion to support people in learning to feel self love again, and relating to themselves and others from that place stems from her belief that relationship w oneself and others is one of the most important aspects to life.

Unique to Michael\u2019s story is that he had already been ordained a priest in an mystical school that was the predecessor to the OCS, called the Holy Order of MANS (aka. HOOM). In this discussion, we dive into his history prior to the OCS, as well as how he came to join, and the unravelment of his experience with Peter Bowes. Since leaving the OCS, Michael has taken up the HOOM name and is carrying it forward with others. Present day, Michael Maciel is a priest and teacher in the Holy Order of MANS,\u00A0 which is categorized as an esoteric school of initiation. He is the author of The Mystical Christ, an online journal of reflections on contemporary spiritual life. He has written two books,  The Five Vows - Raising Your Spiritual Commitment to the Next Level and  World Priest - Bringing Heaven to Earth, and is also the creator of The Mystical Christ Academy, a series of online tutorials for personal spiritual development.\u00A0 Michael has two YouTube channels,  The Mystical Christ and  Lectures and Interviews, a collection of discussions on mystical Bible interpretation and esoteric symbolism. You can also connect with Michael on Facebook.\u00A0 Jennifer is a mental health counselor located in the Los Angeles area, using Internal Family Systems (IFS) as the primary modality of psychotherapy that she uses with clients.

When the teachers leading the group divided, she went with Peter Bowes who renamed his group, Ruach Center. This group is still functioning and Peter Bowes continues to lead the organization. Mari\u2019s story around her leaving is both heartbreaking and eye opening as it provides insight into the psychological torment that all too often happens in groups of high control. As the daughter of Cuban immigrants, Mari was raised in Miami, and currently lives with her family in the Pacific Northwest. Her career has taken her from social worker to midwife, to her current role as a registered nurse and grief revolutionary. Mari is passionate about breaking down the social barriers around grief \u0026 the stigma attached to it. Over the last two decades, she has had the privilege of ushering hundreds through the passage of life and death. Mari is a co-founder and editor of the Grief Rites Foundation, where art is used as agency to live boldly with grief. By curating monthly readings, publishing articles, \u0026 facilitating workshops, Grief Rites creates the space for grief stories to be witnessed.Thank you for your amazing work Mari!

After leaving Zendik in 2004, she helped expose its twisted innards via her Zendik FAQ. More recently, she\u0027s shared her story at the conferences of the International Cultic Studies Association, the Communal Studies Association (which honored Mating in Captivity with its 2020 Timothy Miller Outstanding Book Award), and the International Communal Studies Association. She\u0027s also written about aspects of her cult and communal experiences for Communities and Livelihood magazines, and the Foundation for Intentional Community\u2019s website.

She also worked for EnlightenNext for those years in various roles, helping to launch their online audio offerings, fundraising, and her final role was functioning as Director of Development. I am so moved by Laura\u2019s story and appreciative of all she\u2019s shared so personally. Part of what I really appreciated was how she was able to describe the transformative experience of being drawn into new ideas and experiences, and how powerful this can be. Laura does a beautiful job of sharing multiple anecdotes that string together a clear tapestry of one\u2019s inner process, the struggle along the way, and what keeps us tied. She really captures the power of persuasion and the complications within these groups that come with having deep and real experiences.

He also wrote for What Is Enlightenment? Magazine, a publication that was a widely distributed and highly renowned publication in it\u2019s genre. Joel is currently writing a book about his experiences at EnlightenNext, tentatively titled, \u201CProject Utopia\u201D. He also lives in in Bend, Oregon with his wife, Laura (who will also be on the podcast!), and their son, Jackson.\u00A0 In this podcast you will learn about how Joel and I met at a time when we were both in high demand groups but most importantly, you will hear about his experience in EnlightenNext as well as his thoughts about how and why it fell apart. This story is one that is not readily available online and yet Andrew Cohen\u2019s following was substantial and then seemingly ended abruptly in 2013. Joel shares his observations and thoughts about all of this with a refreshing perspective and insight that only those who were part of the so called inner community of such groups might have.\u00A0 To learn more about Joel\u2019s company: launchmybook.com Jennifer is a mental health counselor located in the Los Angeles area, using Internal Family Systems (IFS) as the primary modality of psychotherapy that she uses with clients.

      "description": "Victoria shares the story of her healing journey from the church she grew up in and the pastor currently leading Truth House Ministry Church. Trigger warning: sexual abuse I believe that one of the most powerful things about this interview is that, through Victoria\u2019s sharing, we really get to understand the courage it takes to speak out as a survivor of sexual abuse but to also have the layer of spiritual abuse on top of that along with the excruciating rejection and inability to get through to those on the inside of a group who are under extreme manipulation and coercion. In this interview, Victoria shares about being raised in the Truth House Ministry Church, run by the pastor, Dr. E.C. Fulcher, Jr. who Victoria says sexually assaulted her at least 15 times over the course of 3 years. Her story reveals the culture of fear and domination existent within this church that has allowed for this pastor to continue to run the church and carry on with business as usual even after authorities obtained a search warrant for Truth House Ministry Church on October 16, 2019, confiscating Fulcher\u2019s mobile phone and conducting a forensic audit that reveals much about his sexual activities and appetites. For more details, please refer to the article that has been written about Victoria\u2019s story at:  http://noedenelsewhere.com/the-truth-about-truth-house-ministry-church-dr-e-c-fulcher-jr/ We hope that this episode helps to get Victoria\u2019s story out into the public sphere so that others know the truth and that authorities engage to stop the possible continued abuse that could be happening.\u00A0 Please contact me with any helpful information or any inquiries regarding the show at projecthopepodcast@jennifer-french.com To check out the Baptist Accountability tracking database: https://baptistaccountability.org/ Check out our podcast affiliate Pure Haven: https://purehaven.com/jenniferfrench Follow Jennifer on social media at:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/jennifermonica.holcomb Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jennifer.french.jfh/ Jennifer is a mental health counselor located in the Los Angeles area, using Internal Family Systems (IFS) as the primary modality of psychotherapy that she uses with clients.

      "description": "In 1989, at the age of 22, Alexandra Amor moved to Vancouver, BC and joined what she thought was a meditation class. Ten years later, she escaped what she describes as having become a mind control cult run by a self-serving guru. Leaving behind all her friends, her spiritual community, her sense of self, and the man she loved, Alexandra moved out into the world searching for healing, and to understand what had happened to her. \u201CCult, A Love Story\u201D is the Amazon best-selling, award-winning memoir that shows by example how we are drawn into high-demand (cultic) groups. And what recovery from that experience looks like.\u00A0 For me, this is one of those books that is helpful from every angle as Alexandra so beautifully writes about her experience and then gives us the bonus of seamlessly weaving it into her own learning about these patterns typically found\u00A0 in cultic groups and controlling leaders. I highly recommend this book for families and friends with a loved one in such a situation as well as those who have left such groups and want a really well written memoir that also serves to educate.
