Like Pam in the last episode, Hersal caught on early that something wasn\u2019t adding up.\n\nHersal is a UNC Chapel Hill basketball superfan \uD83C\uDFC0, a proud husband and dad, a badass cancer survivor (say it with me: #fuckcancer), and quite possibly the nicest human alive. Case in point: I mispronounced his name the entire episode, and this man didn\u2019t correct me once. \uD83D\uDE43 It\u2019s HERSAL, y\u2019all \u2014 not Hershal. My bad, friend.\n\nGet into it, and enjoy! \uD83D\uDD25\uD83C\uDF99\uFE0F\n\nIf you or someone you know has been affected by cult involvement and is seeking help, the following resources are available:\n\nNikki G Speaks (Black owned religious trauma therapist)\nhttps://www.nikkigspeaks.com/\n\nDr. Dylesia Trauma therapist (Black owned)\nhttps://www.radicalchangetherapy.org/...\n\nFreedom of Mind\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/\n\nCult Education Institute\nhttps://culteducation.com/\n\nCult Awareness \u0026 Information Center\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/201706281...\n\nInternational Cultic Studies Association\nhttps://www.icsahome.com/\n\nCult Escape\nhttps://cult-escape.com/\n\nCult News 101\nhttps://www.cultnews101.com/\n\nThank you for listening.   / @blackandcultivated  \n\n#cults #religion #church #comedy #yahweh #cult #black #lanisa",
