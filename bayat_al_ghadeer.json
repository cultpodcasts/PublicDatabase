      "description": "For years, the Ahmadi Religion of Peace \u0026 Light\u0027 has claimed that there are 12 divinely protected Mahdis who come after Prophet Muhammad (saw) and the Twelve Imams (a). But who are these Mahdis and why the secrecy? These belief are hidden from the public.\n\nIn this video, we expose:\n\n\u2013 The true identities behind their so-called \u201CMahdis\u201D\n\u2013 The contradictions in their reincarnation based theology\n\u2013 The apostasy and downfall of these supposed Mahdis\n\u2013 Secret belief of the 12th Imam \u0026 12th Mahdi\n\nWhat they conceal or fail to understand themselves is their belief that the 12th Imam (ajf) has died and reincarnated into their 12th Mahdi who is from illegitimate birth. \n\nIn reality, their teachings render the 12th Imam irrelevant and redundant \u2014 replaced by recycled identities, fallen figures, and spiritual imposters. They claim that \u201CThe Will\u201D protects from misguidance, yet it has only led them deeper into deception, contradiction, and chaos.\n\n@themahdihasappeared \n@ahmadireligion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#AbdullahHashem #12Mahdis #AhmadiReligionExposed #TheGoalOfTheWise #CultWatch #ImamMahdi #Rajaa #Occultation #FalseMahdi #ShiaTheology #ReligiousDeception #SpiritualAbuse",
