Does it even have a source? The simple answer: It\u2019s a ghost narration falsely attributed to the Prophet (saw) and blindly copied by the false \u201CMahdi\u201D Abdullah Hashem. The shocking fact is that this non-existent report is enough to destroy any claim of divine appointment. If the so-called \u201CProof of God\u201D can\u2019t even verify his own hadith sources what does that say about the rest of his teachings?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@themahdihasappeared @ahmadireligion \n\n#AbdullahHashem\n#AbdullahHashim\n#AhmadiReligionOfPeaceAndLight\n#AROPL\n#FalseMahdi\n#ImamMahdi\n#MusnadAhmad\n#FakeHadith\n#KingAbdullah\n#KingFahd\n#SaudiArabia\n#EndTimesProphecy\n#MahdiProphecy\n#IslamicEschatology\n#ShiaIslam\n#SunniIslam\n#CultExposed\n#ReligiousManipulation\n#FabricatedHadith\n#MahdiAppearance\n#ProphecyDebunked\n#EndTimesSigns\n#MahdiClaim\n#CultLeader\n#ReligiousFraud\n#ShiaHadith\n#SunniHadith\n#IslamicProphecy\n#2015MahdiClaim",
