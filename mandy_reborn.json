      "description": "In Episode 2, we explore the good (yes, there were a few positives!) and the downright bizarre lessons I learned while in the cult. Ever thought a power outage was your fault? Welcome to my life back then! Now I\u2019m free and introspective but still can\u2019t help wondering\u2026 what if I started my own nice cult, with perks like paid labour and Japanese toilets? \uD83D\uDE0F\n\nI also break down the sheer incompetence of cult leaders\u2014why isn\u2019t there a training program for them? They\u2019re basically the best illusionists in the world, managing to make you feel both superior and worthless at the same time. That\u2019s some next-level magic! \uD83C\uDFA9\u2728\n\nOh, and did I mention I didn\u2019t leave the cult? I got chased out! Turns out, I was delaying my career\u2026 who knew comedy was so important to the Almighty? Guess who\u2019s chosen now? \uD83E\uDD23\n\nTune in for more laughs, cult confessions, and a wild mix of dark humour and truth!\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 Don\u2019t forget to like, subscribe, and hit the notification bell for Episode 3\n\nChapters:\n\n00:00 - The Positives of Cult Life (Yes, Really)\n00:21 - Introspective thinking \n00:36 - Starting My Own (Nice) Cult\n00:50 - Cult Leaders Need a Training Program!\n01:24 - Cult leaders are the best illusionist \n02:00 - Kicked out of a Cult \n02:29 - Divine Encounter: Why I Got Chased Out\n03:11 - Iyanla fix my life\n\n#ChasedOuttaTheCult #CultSurvivor #ComedyConfessions #CultLife #DarkHumour #CultEscape #DivineComedy #StandUpComedy #RelatableComedy #PharaohsChosen #BizarreTruth #CultLeaders #ComedyInHeaven #CultIllusions\n#comedy #cultsurvivor #darkhu",
